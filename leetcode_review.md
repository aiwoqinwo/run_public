## Greedy
### [621\. Task Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/), [Greedy](https://leetcode.com/tag/greedy/), [Sorting](https://leetcode.com/tag/sorting/), [Heap (Priority Queue)](https://leetcode.com/tag/heap-priority-queue/), [Counting](https://leetcode.com/tag/counting/)


Given a characters array `tasks`, representing the tasks a CPU needs to do, where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done in any order. Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative integer `n` that represents the cooldown period between two **same tasks** (the same letter in the array), that is that there must be at least `n` units of time between any two same tasks.

Return _the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation:
A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
There is at least 2 units of time between any two same tasks.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0
Output: 6
Explanation: On this case any permutation of size 6 would work since n = 0.
["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
["A","B","A","B","A","B"]
["B","B","B","A","A","A"]
...
And so on.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2
Output: 16
Explanation:
One possible solution is
A -> B -> C -> A -> D -> E -> A -> F -> G -> A -> idle -> idle -> A -> idle -> idle -> A
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= task.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `tasks[i]` is upper-case English letter.
*   The integer `n` is in the range `[0, 100]`.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

* [复杂度](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/solution/)
```Python
from collections import Counter

def leastInterval(tasks, n):
    hashmap = Counter(tasks)    
    _, most = hashmap.most_common(1)[0]
    num_most = [num for num, freq in hashmap.items() if freq == most]
    return max(len(tasks), (most - 1) * (n + 1) + len(num_most))

leastInterval(tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2)
leastInterval(tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0)
leastInterval(tasks = ["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2)
```

思路: 算出要多少个 idle time, 然后进行填充. 最后等于 `idle_time + len(tasks)`
```python
tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"]; n = 2

def leastInterval(tasks, n):
    frequencies = [0] * 26
    for t in tasks:
        frequencies[ord(t) - ord('A')] += 1

    frequencies.sort()

    # max frequency
    f_max = frequencies.pop()
    idle_time = (f_max - 1) * n

    while frequencies and idle_time > 0:
        idle_time -= min(f_max - 1, frequencies.pop()) # f_max - 1 表示多出来的后面的就不管了, 因为这里只 focus idle time
    idle_time = max(0, idle_time)

    return idle_time + len(tasks)
```

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Greedy](https://leetcode.com/tag/greedy/), [Sorting](https://leetcode.com/tag/sorting/), [Heap (Priority Queue)](https://leetcode.com/tag/heap-priority-queue/), [Counting](https://leetcode.com/tag/counting/)


Given a string `s`, rearrange the characters of `s` so that any two adjacent characters are not the same.

Return _any possible rearrangement of_ `s` _or return_ `""` _if not possible_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aab"
Output: "aba"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aaab"
Output: ""
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 500`
*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reorganizeString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str

### [277\. Find the Celebrity](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-celebrity/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Two Pointers](https://leetcode.com/tag/two-pointers/), [Greedy](https://leetcode.com/tag/greedy/), [Graph](https://leetcode.com/tag/graph/), [Interactive](https://leetcode.com/tag/interactive/)


Suppose you are at a party with `n` people (labeled from `0` to `n - 1`), and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other `n - 1` people know him/her, but he/she does not know any of them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information about whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` which tells you whether A knows B. Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`. There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/02/277_example_1_bold.PNG)

```
Input: graph = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2\. graph[i][j] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph[i][j] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/02/277_example_2.PNG)

```
Input: graph = [[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no celebrity.
```

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Greedy](https://leetcode.com/tag/greedy/), [Sorting](https://leetcode.com/tag/sorting/)


There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [x<sub style="display: inline;">start</sub>, x<sub style="display: inline;">end</sub>]` denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter** stretches between `x<sub style="display: inline;">start</sub>` and `x<sub style="display: inline;">end</sub>`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `x<sub style="display: inline;">start</sub>` and `x<sub style="display: inline;">end</sub>` is **burst** by an arrow shot at `x` if `x<sub style="display: inline;">start</sub> <= x <= x<sub style="display: inline;">end</sub>`. There is **no limit** to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return _the **minimum** number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= points.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `points[i].length == 2`
*   `-2<sup>31</sup> <= x<sub style="display: inline;">start</sub> < x<sub style="display: inline;">end</sub> <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1`


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
def findMinArrowShots(points):
    points = sorted(points, key = lambda x: x[1])
    count = 1
    right = points[0][1]
    for point in points[1: ]:
        if right < point[0]:
            right = point[1]

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i<sup>th</sup>` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return _the **maximum** profit you can achieve_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>`


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, end<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>]`, return _the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

### [135\. Candy](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/)

Difficulty: **Hard**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Greedy](https://leetcode.com/tag/greedy/)


There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

*   Each child must have at least one candy.
*   Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return _the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == ratings.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>`


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

Go from left to right and while increase, give the the next person +1 candy from previous, if not, leave number of candies as it was. In this way when we make this pass we make sure that condition that person with bigger value gets more candies fulfilled for pairs of adjusent persons where left person is smaller than right. Now, go from right to left and do the same: now we cover pairs of adjacent persons where right is smaller than left. After these two passes all persons are happy.

Complexity
Overall time and space complexity is O(n). Remark: there is also O(1) space complexity solution using the idea of peaks and valleys.
```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, R):
        n, ans = len(R), [1]*len(R)

        for i in range(n-1):
            if R[i] < R[i+1]:

You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the `i<sup>th</sup>` person, and an **infinite number of boats** where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return _the minimum number of boats to carry every given person_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3

There is a school that has classes of students and each class will be having a final exam. You are given a 2D integer array `classes`, where `classes[i] = [pass<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, total<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>]`. You know beforehand that in the `i<sup>th</sup>` class, there are `total<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` total students, but only `pass<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` number of students will pass the exam.

You are also given an integer `extraStudents`. There are another `extraStudents` brilliant students that are **guaranteed** to pass the exam of any class they are assigned to. You want to assign each of the `extraStudents` students to a class in a way that **maximizes** the **average** pass ratio across **all** the classes.

The **pass ratio** of a class is equal to the number of students of the class that will pass the exam divided by the total number of students of the class. The **average pass ratio** is the sum of pass ratios of all the classes divided by the number of the classes.

Return _the **maximum** possible average pass ratio after assigning the_ `extraStudents` _students._ Answers within `10<sup>-5</sup>` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: classes = [[1,2],[3,5],[2,2]], extraStudents = 2

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

### [986\. Interval List Intersections](https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-list-intersections/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Two Pointers](https://leetcode.com/tag/two-pointers/)


You are given two lists of closed intervals, `firstList` and `secondList`, where `firstList[i] = [start<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, end<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>]` and `secondList[j] = [start<sub style="display: inline;">j</sub>, end<sub style="display: inline;">j</sub>]`. Each list of intervals is pairwise **disjoint** and in **sorted order**.

Return _the intersection of these two interval lists_.

A **closed interval** `[a, b]` (with `a <= b`) denotes the set of real numbers `x` with `a <= x <= b`.

The **intersection** of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` is `[2, 3]`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/30/interval1.png)

```
Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: firstList = [], secondList = [[4,8],[10,12]]
Output: []
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: firstList = [[1,7]], secondList = [[3,10]]
Output: [[3,7]]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= firstList.length, secondList.length <= 1000`
*   `firstList.length + secondList.length >= 1`
*   `0 <= start<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub> < end<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub> <= 10<sup>9</sup>`
*   `end<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub> < start<sub style="display: inline;">i+1</sub>`

    i , j = 0, 0
    result = []
    while i < n and j < m:

### [88\. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Two Pointers](https://leetcode.com/tag/two-pointers/), [Sorting](https://leetcode.com/tag/sorting/)


You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array_ `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1\. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `nums1.length == m + n`
*   `nums2.length == n`
*   `0 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `1 <= m + n <= 200`
*   `-10<sup>9</sup> <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10<sup>9</sup>`

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
def merge(nums1, m, nums2, n):
    i, j = m - 1, n - 1
    k = m + n - 1
    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
        if nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
            nums1[k] = nums1[i]
            i -= 1
        else:
            nums1[k] = nums2[j]
            j -= 1
        k -= 1
    while j >= 0:
        nums1[k] = nums2[j]
        j -= 1
        k -= 1
    return nums1

Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Note** that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Constraints:**

### [408\. Valid Word Abbreviation](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-word-abbreviation/)

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Two Pointers](https://leetcode.com/tag/two-pointers/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/)


A string can be **abbreviated** by replacing any number of **non-adjacent**, **non-empty** substrings with their lengths. The lengths **should not** have leading zeros.

For example, a string such as `"substitution"` could be abbreviated as (but not limited to):

*   `"s10n"` (`"s <u style="display: inline;">ubstitutio</u> n"`)
*   `"sub4u4"` (`"sub <u style="display: inline;">stit</u> u <u style="display: inline;">tion</u>"`)
*   `"12"` (`"<u style="display: inline;">substitution</u>"`)
*   `"su3i1u2on"` (`"su <u style="display: inline;">bst</u> i <u style="display: inline;">t</u> u <u style="display: inline;">ti</u> on"`)
*   `"substitution"` (no substrings replaced)

The following are **not valid** abbreviations:

*   `"s55n"` (`"s <u style="display: inline;">ubsti</u> <u style="display: inline;">tutio</u> n"`, the replaced substrings are adjacent)
*   `"s010n"` (has leading zeros)
*   `"s0ubstitution"` (replaces an empty substring)

Given a string `word` and an abbreviation `abbr`, return _whether the string **matches** the given abbreviation_.

A **substring** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word = "internationalization", abbr = "i12iz4n"
Output: true
Explanation: The word "internationalization" can be abbreviated as "i12iz4n" ("i nternational iz atio n").
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word = "apple", abbr = "a2e"
Output: false
Explanation: The word "apple" cannot be abbreviated as "a2e".
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= word.length <= 20`
*   `word` consists of only lowercase English letters.
*   `1 <= abbr.length <= 10`
*   `abbr` consists of lowercase English letters and digits.
*   All the integers in `abbr` will fit in a 32-bit integer.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def validWordAbbreviation(self, word, abbr):    
        i, j = 0, 0
        while i < len(word) and j < len(abbr):
            if abbr[j].isalpha():
                if word[i] !=  abbr[j]:
                    return False
                i += 1
                j += 1
            else:
                if abbr[j] == "0":
                    return False
                tmp = ""
                while j < len(abbr) and abbr[j].isdigit():
                    tmp = tmp + abbr[j]
                    j += 1
                i += int(tmp)

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

### [1861\. Rotating the Box](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotating-the-box/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Two Pointers](https://leetcode.com/tag/two-pointers/), [Matrix](https://leetcode.com/tag/matrix/)


You are given an `m x n` matrix of characters `box` representing a side-view of a box. Each cell of the box is one of the following:

*   A stone `'#'`
*   A stationary obstacle `'*'`
*   Empty `'.'`

The box is rotated **90 degrees clockwise**, causing some of the stones to fall due to gravity. Each stone falls down until it lands on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box. Gravity **does not** affect the obstacles' positions, and the inertia from the box's rotation **does not** affect the stones' horizontal positions.

It is **guaranteed** that each stone in `box` rests on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box.

Return _an_ `n x m` _matrix representing the box after the rotation described above_.

**Example 1:**

### [443\. String Compression](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Two Pointers](https://leetcode.com/tag/two-pointers/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/)


Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of **consecutive repeating characters** in `chars`:

*   If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.
*   Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` **should not be returned separately**, but instead, be stored **in the input character array `chars`**. Note that group lengths that are `10` or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done **modifying the input array**, return _the new length of the array_.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
Explanation: The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: chars = ["a"]
Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]
Explanation: The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
Explanation: The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: chars = ["a","a","a","b","b","a","a"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","3","b","2","a","2"].
Explanation: The groups are "aaa", "bb", and "aa". This compresses to "a3b2a2". Note that each group is independent even if two groups have the same character.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= chars.length <= 2000`
*   `chars[i]` is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
chars = ["a","a","b","c","c","c"]

### [1868\. Product of Two Run-Length Encoded Arrays :rainbow:](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-two-run-length-encoded-arrays/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Two Pointers](https://leetcode.com/tag/two-pointers/)


**Run-length encoding** is a compression algorithm that allows for an integer array `nums` with many segments of **consecutive repeated** numbers to be represented by a (generally smaller) 2D array `encoded`. Each `encoded[i] = [val<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, freq<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>]` describes the `i<sup>th</sup>` segment of repeated numbers in `nums` where `val<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` is the value that is repeated `freq<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` times.

*   For example, `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2]` is represented by the **run-length encoded** array `encoded = [[1,3],[2,5]]`. Another way to read this is "three `1`'s followed by five `2`'s".

The **product** of two run-length encoded arrays `encoded1` and `encoded2` can be calculated using the following steps:

1.  **Expand** both `encoded1` and `encoded2` into the full arrays `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
2.  Create a new array `prodNums` of length `nums1.length` and set `prodNums[i] = nums1[i] * nums2[i]`.
3.  **Compress** `prodNums` into a run-length encoded array and return it.

You are given two **run-length encoded** arrays `encoded1` and `encoded2` representing full arrays `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. Both `nums1` and `nums2` have the **same length**. Each `encoded1[i] = [val<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, freq<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>]` describes the `i<sup>th</sup>` segment of `nums1`, and each `encoded2[j] = [val<sub style="display: inline;">j</sub>, freq<sub style="display: inline;">j</sub>]` describes the `j<sup>th</sup>` segment of `nums2`.

Return _the **product** of_ `encoded1` _and_ `encoded2`.

**Note:** Compression should be done such that the run-length encoded array has the **minimum** possible length.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: encoded1 = [[1,3],[2,3]], encoded2 = [[6,3],[3,3]]
Output: [[6,6]]
Explanation: encoded1 expands to [1,1,1,2,2,2] and encoded2 expands to [6,6,6,3,3,3].
prodNums = [6,6,6,6,6,6], which is compressed into the run-length encoded array [[6,6]].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: encoded1 = [[1,3],[2,1],[3,2]], encoded2 = [[2,3],[3,3]]
Output: [[2,3],[6,1],[9,2]]
Explanation: encoded1 expands to [1,1,1,2,3,3] and encoded2 expands to [2,2,2,3,3,3].
prodNums = [2,2,2,6,9,9], which is compressed into the run-length encoded array [[2,3],[6,1],[9,2]].
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= encoded1.length, encoded2.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `encoded1[i].length == 2`
*   `encoded2[j].length == 2`
*   `1 <= val<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, freq<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub> <= 10<sup>4</sup>` for each `encoded1[i]`.
*   `1 <= val<sub style="display: inline;">j</sub>, freq<sub style="display: inline;">j</sub> <= 10<sup>4</sup>` for each `encoded2[j]`.
*   The full arrays that `encoded1` and `encoded2` represent are the same length.

### [809\. Expressive Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/expressive-words/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Two Pointers](https://leetcode.com/tag/two-pointers/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/)


Sometimes people repeat letters to represent extra feeling. For example:

*   `"hello" -> "heeellooo"`
*   `"hi" -> "hiiii"`

In these strings like `"heeellooo"`, we have groups of adjacent letters that are all the same: `"h"`, `"eee"`, `"ll"`, `"ooo"`.

You are given a string `s` and an array of query strings `words`. A query word is **stretchy** if it can be made to be equal to `s` by any number of applications of the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of characters `c`, and add some number of characters `c` to the group so that the size of the group is **three or more**.

*   For example, starting with `"hello"`, we could do an extension on the group `"o"` to get `"hellooo"`, but we cannot get `"helloo"` since the group `"oo"` has a size less than three. Also, we could do another extension like `"ll" -> "lllll"` to get `"helllllooo"`. If `s = "helllllooo"`, then the query word `"hello"` would be **stretchy** because of these two extension operations: `query = "hello" -> "hellooo" -> "helllllooo" = s`.

Return _the number of query strings that are **stretchy**_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "heeellooo", words = ["hello", "hi", "helo"]
Output: 1
Explanation:
We can extend "e" and "o" in the word "hello" to get "heeellooo".
We can't extend "helo" to get "heeellooo" because the group "ll" is not size 3 or more.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "zzzzzyyyyy", words = ["zzyy","zy","zyy"]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length, words.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
*   `s` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase letters.

### [134\. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Greedy](https://leetcode.com/tag/greedy/)


There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `i<sup>th</sup>` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `i<sup>th</sup>` station to its next `(i + 1)<sup>th</sup>` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return _the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return_ `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**

**Example 1:**

```
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4\. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0\. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1\. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2\. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3\. The cost is 5\. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0\. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1\. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `gas.length == n`
*   `cost.length == n`
*   `1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>`


#### Solution

            return -1
        remain = start = 0
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            if remain + gas[i] < cost[i]:
                remain = 0
                start = i + 1
            else:

### [763\. Partition Labels :rainbow:](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/)

Difficulty: **Medium**

You are given a string `s`. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.

Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be `s`.

Return _a list of integers representing the size of these parts_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
Output: [10]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 500`
*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

Related Topics: [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-search/), [Interactive](https://leetcode.com/tag/interactive/)


You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= bad <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1`


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# @param version, an integer
# @return a bool
# def isBadVersion(version):
​
def firstBadVersion(n, bad):
    left = 1
    right = n
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) / 2
        if isBadVersion(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-search/)


Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value.

If `target` is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1,-1]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `-10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>`
*   `nums` is a non-decreasing array.
*   `-10<sup>9</sup> <= target <= 10<sup>9</sup>`


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

The idea is to use `bisect` (which is also `bisect_right`) and `bisect_left` to get the range of numbers: first one will return index before all repetitions of `target` and the second one: after. So, if these two indexes are equal, it means that we did not found this element, so we return `[-1, -1]`. If we found, we return `[l, r - 1]`.

You are given a **0-indexed** array of positive integers `w` where `w[i]` describes the **weight** of the `i<sup>th</sup>` index.

You need to implement the function `pickIndex()`, which **randomly** picks an index in the range `[0, w.length - 1]` (**inclusive**) and returns it. The **probability** of picking an index `i` is `w[i] / sum(w)`.

*   For example, if `w = [1, 3]`, the probability of picking index `0` is `1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25` (i.e., `25%`), and the probability of picking index `1` is `3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75` (i.e., `75%`).

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0\. The only option is to return 0 since there is only one element in w.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1\. It is returning the second element (index = 1) that has a probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0\. It is returning the first element (index = 0) that has a probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed.
All of the following outputs can be considered correct:
[null,1,1,1,1,0]
[null,1,1,1,1,1]
[null,1,1,1,0,0]
[null,1,1,1,0,1]
[null,1,0,1,0,0]

and so on.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= w.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-search/)


There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of_ `target` _if it is in_ `nums`_, or_ `-1` _if it is not in_ `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
*   `-10<sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   All values of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
*   `-10<sup>4</sup> <= target <= 10<sup>4</sup>`

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-search/)


There is an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with **distinct** values).

Before being passed to your function, `nums` is **rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`0 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `5` and become `[4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the rotation and an integer `target`, return `true` _if_ `target` _is in_ `nums`_, or_ `false` _if it is not in_ `nums`_._

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
*   `-10<sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `nums` is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
*   `-10<sup>4</sup> <= target <= 10<sup>4</sup>`

**Follow up:** This problem is similar to , but `nums` may contain **duplicates**. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?

Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.

Implement the `TimeMap` class:

*   `TimeMap()` Initializes the object of the data structure.
*   `void set(String key, String value, int timestamp)` Stores the key `key` with the value `value` at the given time `timestamp`.
*   `String get(String key, int timestamp)` Returns a value such that `set` was called previously, with `timestamp_prev <= timestamp`. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest `timestamp_prev`. If there are no values, it returns `""`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["TimeMap", "set", "get", "get", "set", "get", "get"]
[[], ["foo", "bar", 1], ["foo", 1], ["foo", 3], ["foo", "bar2", 4], ["foo", 4], ["foo", 5]]
Output
[null, null, "bar", "bar", null, "bar2", "bar2"]

Explanation
TimeMap timeMap = new TimeMap();
timeMap.set("foo", "bar", 1);  // store the key "foo" and value "bar" along with timestamp = 1.
timeMap.get("foo", 1);         // return "bar"
timeMap.get("foo", 3);         // return "bar", since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 3 and timestamp 2, then the only value is at timestamp 1 is "bar".
timeMap.set("foo", "bar2", 4); // store the key "foo" and value "bar2" along with timestamp = 4.
timeMap.get("foo", 4);         // return "bar2"
timeMap.get("foo", 5);         // return "bar2"
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= key.length, value.length <= 100`
*   `key` and `value` consist of lowercase English letters and digits.
*   `1 <= timestamp <= 10<sup>7</sup>`
*   All the timestamps `timestamp` of `set` are strictly increasing.
*   At most `2 * 10<sup>5</sup>` calls will be made to `set` and `get`.

We have `n` jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from `startTime[i]` to `endTime[i]`, obtaining a profit of `profit[i]`.

You're given the `startTime`, `endTime` and `profit` arrays, return the maximum profit you can take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.

If you choose a job that ends at time `X` you will be able to start another job that starts at time `X`.

```
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]
Output: 120
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth job.
Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-search/)


Given an integer array `bloomDay`, an integer `m` and an integer `k`.

We need to make `m` bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use `k` **adjacent flowers** from the garden.

The garden consists of `n` flowers, the `ith` flower will bloom in the `bloomDay[i]` and then can be used in **exactly one** bouquet.

Return _the minimum number of days_ you need to wait to be able to make `m` bouquets from the garden. If it is impossible to make `m` bouquets return **-1**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: Let's see what happened in the first three days. x means flower bloomed and _ means flower didn't bloom in the garden.
We need 3 bouquets each should contain 1 flower.
After day 1: [x, _, _, _, _]   // we can only make one bouquet.
After day 2: [x, _, _, _, x]   // we can only make two bouquets.
After day 3: [x, _, x, _, x]   // we can make 3 bouquets. The answer is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: We need 3 bouquets each has 2 flowers, that means we need 6 flowers. We only have 5 flowers so it is impossible to get the needed bouquets and we return -1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: bloomDay = [7,7,7,7,12,7,7], m = 2, k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: We need 2 bouquets each should have 3 flowers.
Here's the garden after the 7 and 12 days:
After day 7: [x, x, x, x, _, x, x]
We can make one bouquet of the first three flowers that bloomed. We cannot make another bouquet from the last three flowers that bloomed because they are not adjacent.
After day 12: [x, x, x, x, x, x, x]
It is obvious that we can make two bouquets in different ways.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: bloomDay = [1000000000,1000000000], m = 1, k = 1
Output: 1000000000
Explanation: You need to wait 1000000000 days to have a flower ready for a bouquet.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: bloomDay = [1,10,2,9,3,8,4,7,5,6], m = 4, k = 2
Output: 9

A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within `days` days.

The `i<sup>th</sup>` package on the conveyor belt has a weight of `weights[i]`. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by `weights`). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.

Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within `days` days.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], days = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], days = 3

```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: 1
Explanation: n = 1 since there is 1 number, so all numbers are in the range [0,1]. 1 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
*   All the numbers of `nums` are **unique**.

**Follow up:** Could you implement a solution using only `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` runtime complexity?

### [702\. Search in a Sorted Array of Unknown Size](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-sorted-array-of-unknown-size/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-search/), [Interactive](https://leetcode.com/tag/interactive/)


This is an **_interactive problem_**.

You have a sorted array of **unique** elements and an **unknown size**. You do not have an access to the array but you can use the `ArrayReader` interface to access it. You can call `ArrayReader.get(i)` that:

*   returns the value at the `i<sup>th</sup>` index (**0-indexed**) of the secret array (i.e., `secret[i]`), or
*   returns `2<sup>31</sup> - 1` if the `i` is out of the boundary of the array.

You are also given an integer `target`.

Return the index `k` of the hidden array where `secret[k] == target` or return `-1` otherwise.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: secret = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in secret and its index is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: secret = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in secret so return -1.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= secret.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `-10<sup>4</sup> <= secret[i], target <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `secret` is sorted in a strictly increasing order.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def search(self, reader, target):
        """
        :type reader: ArrayReader
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        low = 0
        high = 1

        while reader.get(high) < target:
            low = high

        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high)/2

            if reader.get(mid) == target:
                return mid
            elif reader.get(mid) > target:
                high = mid - 1

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-search/)


You are given an integer array `ribbons`, where `ribbons[i]` represents the length of the `i<sup>th</sup>` ribbon, and an integer `k`. You may cut any of the ribbons into any number of segments of **positive integer** lengths, or perform no cuts at all.

*   For example, if you have a ribbon of length `4`, you can:
    *   Keep the ribbon of length `4`,
    *   Cut it into one ribbon of length `3` and one ribbon of length `1`,
    *   Cut it into two ribbons of length `2`,
    *   Cut it into one ribbon of length `2` and two ribbons of length `1`, or
    *   Cut it into four ribbons of length `1`.

Your goal is to obtain `k` ribbons of all the **same positive integer length**. You are allowed to throw away any excess ribbon as a result of cutting.

Return _the **maximum** possible positive integer length that you can obtain_ `k` _ribbons of__, or_ `0` _if you cannot obtain_ `k` _ribbons of the same length_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ribbons = [9,7,5], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
- Cut the first ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 5 and one of length 4.
- Cut the second ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 5 and one of length 2.
- Keep the third ribbon as it is.
Now you have 3 ribbons of length 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ribbons = [7,5,9], k = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
- Cut the first ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 4 and one of length 3.
- Cut the second ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 4 and one of length 1.
- Cut the third ribbon to three ribbons, two of length 4 and one of length 1.
Now you have 4 ribbons of length 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: ribbons = [5,7,9], k = 22
Output: 0
Explanation: You cannot obtain k ribbons of the same positive integer length.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= ribbons.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `1 <= ribbons[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `1 <= k <= 10<sup>9</sup>`


#### Solution

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `i<sup>th</sup>` paper and `citations` is sorted in an **ascending order**, return compute the researcher's `h`**-index**.

According to the : A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n − h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the `h`**-index**.

You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

```
Input: citations = [1,2,100]
Output: 2

**Constraints:**

*   `n == citations.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>`

A social media company is trying to monitor activity on their site by analyzing the number of tweets that occur in select periods of time. These periods can be partitioned into smaller **time chunks** based on a certain frequency (every **minute**, **hour**, or **day**).

For example, the period `[10, 10000]` (in **seconds**) would be partitioned into the following **time chunks** with these frequencies:

*   Every **minute** (60-second chunks): `[10,69]`, `[70,129]`, `[130,189]`, `...`, `[9970,10000]`
*   Every **hour** (3600-second chunks): `[10,3609]`, `[3610,7209]`, `[7210,10000]`
*   Every **day** (86400-second chunks): `[10,10000]`

Notice that the last chunk may be shorter than the specified frequency's chunk size and will always end with the end time of the period (`10000` in the above example).

Design and implement an API to help the company with their analysis.

Implement the `TweetCounts` class:

*   `TweetCounts()` Initializes the `TweetCounts` object.
*   `void recordTweet(String tweetName, int time)` Stores the `tweetName` at the recorded `time` (in **seconds**).
*   `List<Integer> getTweetCountsPerFrequency(String freq, String tweetName, int startTime, int endTime)` Returns a list of integers representing the number of tweets with `tweetName` in each **time chunk** for the given period of time `[startTime, endTime]` (in **seconds**) and frequency `freq`.
    *   `freq` is one of `"minute"`, `"hour"`, or `"day"` representing a frequency of every **minute**, **hour**, or **day** respectively.

**Example:**

```
Input
["TweetCounts","recordTweet","recordTweet","recordTweet","getTweetCountsPerFrequency","getTweetCountsPerFrequency","recordTweet","getTweetCountsPerFrequency"]

tweetCounts.getTweetCountsPerFrequency("hour", "tweet3", 0, 210);  // return [4]; chunk [0,210] had 4 tweets
```

**Constraints:**

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-search/)


Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `i<sup>th</sup>` pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return _the minimum integer_ `k` _such that she can eat all the bananas within_ `h` _hours_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23
```

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Sorting](https://leetcode.com/tag/sorting/)


You are given two strings order and s. All the words of `order` are **unique** and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of `s` so that they match the order that `order` was sorted. More specifically, if a character `x` occurs before a character `y` in `order`, then `x` should occur before `y` in the permuted string.

Return _any permutation of_ `s` _that satisfies this property_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: order = "cba", s = "abcd"
Output: "cbad"
Explanation:
"a", "b", "c" appear in order, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a".
Since "d" does not appear in order, it can be at any position in the returned string. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: order = "cbafg", s = "abcd"
Output: "cbad"
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= order.length <= 26`
*   `1 <= s.length <= 200`
*   `order` and `s` consist of lowercase English letters.
*   All the characters of `order` are **unique**.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**


```python
from collections import Counter

def customSortString(order, s):
    counter = Counter(s)
    result = ''
    for chr in order:
        result += chr * counter.get(chr, 0)
        counter[chr] = 0
    for chr in s:
        if counter[chr] != 0:
            result += chr
    return result

### [57\. Insert Interval](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/)


You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, end<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>]` represent the start and the end of the `i<sup>th</sup>` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `start<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `start<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` _after the insertion_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: intervals = [], newInterval = [5,7]
Output: [[5,7]]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,5]], newInterval = [2,3]
Output: [[1,5]]
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,5]], newInterval = [2,7]
Output: [[1,7]]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= intervals.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `intervals[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= start<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub> <= end<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub> <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `intervals` is sorted by `start<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` in **ascending** order.
*   `newInterval.length == 2`
*   `0 <= start <= end <= 10<sup>5</sup>`


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```Python
def insert(intervals, newInterval):
    res = []
    for i, interval in enumerate(intervals):
        if interval[1] < newInterval[0]:

        else:  # overlap case
            newInterval[0] = min(newInterval[0], interval[0])
            newInterval[1] = max(newInterval[1], interval[1])

Given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where each `1` marks the home of one friend, return _the minimal **total travel distance**_.

The **total travel distance** is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.

The distance is calculated using , where `distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/meetingpoint-grid.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Given three friends living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2).
The point (0,2) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 is minimal.
So return 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,1]]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
*   There will be **at least two** friends in the `grid`.


#### Solution

In a special ranking system, each voter gives a rank from highest to lowest to all teams participated in the competition.

The ordering of teams is decided by who received the most position-one votes. If two or more teams tie in the first position, we consider the second position to resolve the conflict, if they tie again, we continue this process until the ties are resolved. If two or more teams are still tied after considering all positions, we rank them alphabetically based on their team letter.

Given an array of strings `votes` which is the votes of all voters in the ranking systems. Sort all teams according to the ranking system described above.

Return _a string of all teams_ **sorted** by the ranking system.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: votes = ["ABC","ACB","ABC","ACB","ACB"]
Output: "ACB"
Explanation: Team A was ranked first place by 5 voters. No other team was voted as first place so team A is the first team.
Team B was ranked second by 2 voters and was ranked third by 3 voters.
Team C was ranked second by 3 voters and was ranked third by 2 voters.
As most of the voters ranked C second, team C is the second team and team B is the third.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: votes = ["WXYZ","XYZW"]
Output: "XWYZ"
Explanation: X is the winner due to tie-breaking rule. X has same votes as W for the first position but X has one vote as second position while W doesn't have any votes as second position.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: votes = ["ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK"]
Output: "ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK"
Explanation: Only one voter so his votes are used for the ranking.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: votes = ["BCA","CAB","CBA","ABC","ACB","BAC"]
Output: "ABC"
Explanation:
Team A was ranked first by 2 voters, second by 2 voters and third by 2 voters.
Team B was ranked first by 2 voters, second by 2 voters and third by 2 voters.
Team C was ranked first by 2 voters, second by 2 voters and third by 2 voters.
There is a tie and we rank teams ascending by their IDs.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: votes = ["M","M","M","M"]
Output: "M"
Explanation: Only team M in the competition so it has the first rank.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= votes.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= votes[i].length <= 26`
*   `votes[i].length == votes[j].length` for `0 <= i, j < votes.length`.
*   `votes[i][j]` is an English **upper-case** letter.
*   All characters of `votes[i]` are unique.
*   All the characters that occur in `votes[0]` **also occur** in `votes[j]` where `1 <= j < votes.length`.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
def rankTeams(votes):
    n = len(votes[0])
    score = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(26)]
    for vote in votes:
        for j, v in enumerate(vote):

            score[i][j] += 1
            score[i][n] = -ord(v)
    score.sort(reverse=True)

Given an integer array `nums`, reorder it such that `nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]...`.

You may assume the input array always has a valid answer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,1,1,6,4]
Output: [1,6,1,5,1,4]
Explanation: [1,4,1,5,1,6] is also accepted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,2,2,3,1]
Output: [2,3,1,3,1,2]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
*   It is guaranteed that there will be an answer for the given input `nums`.

**Follow Up:** Can you do it in `O(n)` time and/or **in-place** with `O(1)` extra space?

#### Solution

Language: **Python**

Roughly speaking I put the smaller half of the numbers on the even indexes and the larger half on the odd indexes.
```python
def wiggleSort(self, nums):
    nums.sort()
    half = len(nums[::2]) - 1
    nums[::2], nums[1::2] = nums[half::-1], nums[:half:-1]
```
I put the smaller half of the numbers on the even indexes and the larger half on the odd indexes, both from right to left:

```
Example nums = [1,2,...,7]      Example nums = [1,2,...,8]

Small half:  4 . 3 . 2 . 1      Small half:  4 . 3 . 2 . 1 .
Large half:  . 7 . 6 . 5 .      Large half:  . 8 . 7 . 6 . 5

You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto **one truck**. You are given a 2D array `boxTypes`, where `boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxes<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, numberOfUnitsPerBox<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>]`:

*   `numberOfBoxes<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` is the number of boxes of type `i`.
*   `numberOfUnitsPerBox<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>`is the number of units in each box of the type `i`.

You are also given an integer `truckSize`, which is the **maximum** number of **boxes** that can be put on the truck. You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed `truckSize`.

Return _the **maximum** total number of **units** that can be put on the truck._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: boxTypes = [[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]], truckSize = 4
Output: 8
Explanation: There are:
- 1 box of the first type that contains 3 units.
- 2 boxes of the second type that contain 2 units each.
- 3 boxes of the third type that contain 1 unit each.
You can take all the boxes of the first and second types, and one box of the third type.
The total number of units will be = (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 8.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: boxTypes = [[5,10],[2,5],[4,7],[3,9]], truckSize = 10
Output: 91
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= boxTypes.length <= 1000`

Given the `root` of a binary tree, calculate the **vertical order traversal** of the binary tree.

For each node at position `(row, col)`, its left and right children will be at positions `(row + 1, col - 1)` and `(row + 1, col + 1)` respectively. The root of the tree is at `(0, 0)`.

The **vertical order traversal** of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column. There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values.

Return _the **vertical order traversal** of the binary tree_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/29/vtree1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
Explanation:
Column -1: Only node 9 is in this column.
Column 0: Nodes 3 and 15 are in this column in that order from top to bottom.
Column 1: Only node 20 is in this column.
Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/29/vtree2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation:
Column -2: Only node 4 is in this column.
Column -1: Only node 2 is in this column.
Column 0: Nodes 1, 5, and 6 are in this column.
          1 is at the top, so it comes first.
          5 and 6 are at the same position (2, 0), so we order them by their value, 5 before 6.
Column 1: Only node 3 is in this column.
Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/29/vtree3.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,6,5,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation:
This case is the exact same as example 2, but with nodes 5 and 6 swapped.
Note that the solution remains the same since 5 and 6 are in the same location and should be ordered by their values.

You are given an `m x n` grid `grid` of values `0`, `1`, or `2`, where:

*   each `0` marks **an empty land** that you can pass by freely,
*   each `1` marks **a building** that you cannot pass through, and
*   each `2` marks **an obstacle** that you cannot pass through.

You want to build a house on an empty land that reaches all buildings in the **shortest total travel** distance. You can only move up, down, left, and right.

Return _the **shortest travel distance** for such a house_. If it is not possible to build such a house according to the above rules, return `-1`.

The **total travel distance** is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.

The distance is calculated using , where `distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2).
The point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal.
So return 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,0]]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

### [339\. Nested List Weight Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/nested-list-weight-sum/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Depth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/depth-first-search/), [Breadth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/breadth-first-search/)


You are given a nested list of integers `nestedList`. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

The **depth** of an integer is the number of lists that it is inside of. For example, the nested list `[1,[2,2],[[3],2],1]` has each integer's value set to its **depth**.

Return _the sum of each integer in_ `nestedList` _multiplied by its **depth**_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/14/nestedlistweightsumex1.png)

```
Input: nestedList = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Four 1's at depth 2, one 2 at depth 1\. 1*2 + 1*2 + 2*1 + 1*2 + 1*2 = 10.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/14/nestedlistweightsumex2.png)

```
Input: nestedList = [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: 27
Explanation: One 1 at depth 1, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 3\. 1*1 + 4*2 + 6*3 = 27.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nestedList = [0]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nestedList.length <= 50`
*   The values of the integers in the nested list is in the range `[-100, 100]`.
*   The maximum **depth** of any integer is less than or equal to `50`.

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Breadth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/breadth-first-search/)


In an **infinite** chess board with coordinates from `-infinity` to `+infinity`, you have a **knight** at square `[0, 0]`.

A knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/knight.png)

Return _the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square_ `[x, y]`. It is guaranteed the answer exists.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 2, y = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = 5, y = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1] → [4, 2] → [3, 4] → [5, 5]
```

Difficulty: **Hard**  

Related Topics: [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Backtracking](https://leetcode.com/tag/backtracking/), [Breadth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/breadth-first-search/)


A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s<sub style="display: inline;">1</sub> -> s<sub style="display: inline;">2</sub> -> ... -> s<sub style="display: inline;">k</sub>` such that:

*   Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
*   Every `s<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
*   `s<sub style="display: inline;">k</sub> == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _all the **shortest transformation sequences** from_ `beginWord` _to_ `endWord`_, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words_ `[beginWord, s<sub style="display: inline;">1</sub>, s<sub style="display: inline;">2</sub>, ..., s<sub style="display: inline;">k</sub>]`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]
Explanation: There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
"hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
"hit" -> "hot" -> "lot" -> "log" -> "cog"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: []
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= beginWord.length <= 5`
*   `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
*   `1 <= wordList.length <= 1000`
*   `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
*   `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
*   `beginWord != endWord`
*   All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

* Time: `O(N * 26 * W^2 + A)`, where `N <= 1000` is number of words in `wordList`, `W <= 5` is length of each words, `A` is total number of sequences.
    * BFS costs `O(E + V)`, where `E` is number of edges, `V` is number of vertices.
    * Because words need to be existed in the `wordList`, so there is total `N` words, it's also the number of vertices.
    * To find neighbors for a word, it costs `O(26 * W * W)`, in the worst case, we have to find the neighbors of `N` words, so there is total `O(N * 26 * W^2)` edges.
* Space: `O(N*W + A)`


```python
from collections import defaultdict
from string import ascii_lowercase

def findLadders(beginWord, endWord, wordList):
    wordSet = set(wordList)  # to check if a word is existed in the wordSet, in O(1)
    wordSet.discard(beginWord)

        for i in range(len(word)):  # change every possible single letters and check if it's in wordSet
            for c in ascii_lowercase:
                newWord = word[:i] + c + word[i + 1:]
                if newWord in wordSet:
                    yield newWord

* Breadth first search in the worst case might go to each of the NN words. For each word, we need to examine M possible intermediate words/combinations. Notice, we have used the substring operation to find each of the combination. Thus, M combinations take O({M} ^ 2) time.
* Each word in the word list would have MM intermediate combinations. To create the all_combo_dict dictionary we save an intermediate word as the key and its corresponding original words as the value. Note, for each of M intermediate words we save the original word of length M. This simply means, for every word we would need a space of {M}^2.

You are given an array `routes` representing bus routes where `routes[i]` is a bus route that the `i<sup>th</sup>` bus repeats forever.

*   For example, if `routes[0] = [1, 5, 7]`, this means that the `0<sup>th</sup>` bus travels in the sequence `1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> ...` forever.

You will start at the bus stop `source` (You are not on any bus initially), and you want to go to the bus stop `target`. You can travel between bus stops by buses only.

Return _the least number of buses you must take to travel from_ `source` _to_ `target`. Return `-1` if it is not possible.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: routes = [[1,2,7],[3,6,7]], source = 1, target = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the second bus to the bus stop 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: routes = [[7,12],[4,5,15],[6],[15,19],[9,12,13]], source = 15, target = 12

Related Topics: [Tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/tree/), [Depth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/depth-first-search/), [Breadth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/breadth-first-search/)


A company has `n` employees with a unique ID for each employee from `0` to `n - 1`. The head of the company is the one with `headID`.

Each employee has one direct manager given in the `manager` array where `manager[i]` is the direct manager of the `i-th` employee, `manager[headID] = -1`. Also, it is guaranteed that the subordination relationships have a tree structure.

The head of the company wants to inform all the company employees of an urgent piece of news. He will inform his direct subordinates, and they will inform their subordinates, and so on until all employees know about the urgent news.

The `i-th` employee needs `informTime[i]` minutes to inform all of his direct subordinates (i.e., After informTime[i] minutes, all his direct subordinates can start spreading the news).

Return _the number of minutes_ needed to inform all the employees about the urgent news.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1, headID = 0, manager = [-1], informTime = [0]
Output: 0
Explanation: The head of the company is the only employee in the company.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 6, headID = 2, manager = [2,2,-1,2,2,2], informTime = [0,0,1,0,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: The head of the company with id = 2 is the direct manager of all the employees in the company and needs 1 minute to inform them all.
The tree structure of the employees in the company is shown.

Input: n = 7, headID = 6, manager = [1,2,3,4,5,6,-1], informTime = [0,6,5,4,3,2,1]
Output: 21
Explanation: The head has id = 6\. He will inform employee with id = 5 in 1 minute.
The employee with id = 5 will inform the employee with id = 4 in 2 minutes.
The employee with id = 4 will inform the employee with id = 3 in 3 minutes.
The employee with id = 3 will inform the employee with id = 2 in 4 minutes.
The employee with id = 2 will inform the employee with id = 1 in 5 minutes.
The employee with id = 1 will inform the employee with id = 0 in 6 minutes.
Needed time = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: n = 15, headID = 0, manager = [-1,0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6], informTime = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first minute the head will inform employees 1 and 2.
The second minute they will inform employees 3, 4, 5 and 6.
The third minute they will inform the rest of employees.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: n = 4, headID = 2, manager = [3,3,-1,2], informTime = [0,0,162,914]
Output: 1076
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `0 <= headID < n`
*   `manager.length == n`
*   `0 <= manager[i] < n`
*   `manager[headID] == -1`
*   `informTime.length == n`
*   `0 <= informTime[i] <= 1000`
*   `informTime[i] == 0` if employee `i` has no subordinates.
*   It is **guaranteed** that all the employees can be informed.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

* Solution 1: Top down DFS
* `dfs` find out the time needed for each employees.
* The time for a manager = `max(manager's employees) + informTime[manager]`
* Time `O(N)`, Space `O(N)`

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def numOfMinutes(n, headID, manager, informTime):
    rst = 0
    childs = defaultdict(list)
    for idx, parent in enumerate(manager):
        childs[parent].append(idx)

    q = deque([(headID, informTime[headID])])
    while q:
        cur_id, cur_time = q.popleft()
        # calculate max
        rst = max(rst, cur_time)
        for child in childs[cur_id]:
            q.append((child, cur_time + informTime[child]))
    return rst

n = 6; headID = 2; manager = [2,2,-1,2,2,2]; informTime = [0,0,1,0,0,0]

Difficulty: **Hard**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Breadth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/breadth-first-search/), [Matrix](https://leetcode.com/tag/matrix/)


You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid` where each cell is either `0` (empty) or `1` (obstacle). You can move up, down, left, or right from and to an empty cell in **one step**.

Return _the minimum number of **steps** to walk from the upper left corner_ `(0, 0)` _to the lower right corner_ `(m - 1, n - 1)` _given that you can eliminate **at most**_ `k` _obstacles_. If it is not possible to find such walk return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/30/short1-grid.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,0,0]], k = 1
Output: 6
Explanation:
The shortest path without eliminating any obstacle is 10.
The shortest path with one obstacle elimination at position (3,2) is 6\. Such path is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (4,2).
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/30/short2-grid.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[0,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,0,0]], k = 1
Output: -1
Explanation: We need to eliminate at least two obstacles to find such a walk.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 40`
*   `1 <= k <= m * n`
*   `grid[i][j]` is either `0` **or** `1`.

### [864\. Shortest Path to Get All Keys](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-to-get-all-keys/)

Difficulty: **Hard**  

Related Topics: [Bit Manipulation](https://leetcode.com/tag/bit-manipulation/), [Breadth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/breadth-first-search/)


You are given an `m x n` grid `grid` where:

*   `'.'` is an empty cell.
*   `'#'` is a wall.
*   `'@'` is the starting point.
*   Lowercase letters represent keys.
*   Uppercase letters represent locks.

You start at the starting point and one move consists of walking one space in one of the four cardinal directions. You cannot walk outside the grid, or walk into a wall.

If you walk over a key, you can pick it up and you cannot walk over a lock unless you have its corresponding key.

For some `<font face="monospace" style="display: inline;">1 <= k <= 6</font>`, there is exactly one lowercase and one uppercase letter of the first `k` letters of the English alphabet in the grid. This means that there is exactly one key for each lock, and one lock for each key; and also that the letters used to represent the keys and locks were chosen in the same order as the English alphabet.

Return _the lowest number of moves to acquire all keys_. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-keys2.jpg)

```
Input: grid = ["@.a.#","###.#","b.A.B"]
Output: 8
Explanation: Note that the goal is to obtain all the keys not to open all the locks.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-key2.jpg)

```
Input: grid = ["@..aA","..B#.","....b"]
Output: 6
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-keys3.jpg)

```
Input: grid = ["@Aa"]
Output: -1
```

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 30`
*   `grid[i][j]` is either an English letter, `'.'`, `'#'`, or `'@'`.
*   The number of keys in the grid is in the range `[1, 6]`.
*   Each key in the grid is **unique**.
*   Each key in the grid has a matching lock.

* [解题大意](https://buptwc.github.io/2018/07/09/leetcode-865-Shortest-Path-to-Get-All-keys/)

1. 首先遍历一次数组，记录下起始位置，即‘@’，以及key的数量，即小写字母的数量，记为numOfKey
2. 队列中的每项元素具有如下结构`(i,j,step,key,collectedkey)`:
    1. i,j表示位置,`step`代表bfs的深度
    2. `key`代表目前能走的格子从，初始化为`'abcdef.@'`，每收集到一个小写字母便将对应的大写字母加入key中
    3. `collectedkey`代表已经收集的key的数量，如果`collectedkey = numOfKey`，则代表成功
3. 用visited记录已经走过的状态，避免无限循环，visited中值为(i,j,key)，保证只有在收集到新key之后才能走回头路

There is a ball in a `maze` with empty spaces (represented as `0`) and walls (represented as `1`). The ball can go through the empty spaces by rolling **up, down, left or right**, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction.

Given the `m x n` `maze`, the ball's `start` position and the `destination`, where `start = [start<sub style="display: inline;">row</sub>, start<sub style="display: inline;">col</sub>]` and `destination = [destination<sub style="display: inline;">row</sub>, destination<sub style="display: inline;">col</sub>]`, return `true` if the ball can stop at the destination, otherwise return `false`.

You may assume that **the borders of the maze are all walls** (see examples).

Output: false
Explanation: There is no way for the ball to stop at the destination. Notice that you can pass through the destination but you cannot stop there.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: maze = [[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1],[0,1,0,0,0]], start = [4,3], destination = [0,1]

### [909\. Snakes and Ladders](https://leetcode.com/problems/snakes-and-ladders/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Breadth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/breadth-first-search/), [Matrix](https://leetcode.com/tag/matrix/)


You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `board` where the cells are labeled from `1` to `n<sup>2</sup>` in a starting from the bottom left of the board (i.e. `board[n - 1][0]`) and alternating direction each row.

You start on square `1` of the board. In each move, starting from square `curr`, do the following:

*   Choose a destination square `next` with a label in the range `[curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n<sup>2</sup>)]`.
    *   This choice simulates the result of a standard **6-sided die roll**: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.
*   If `next` has a snake or ladder, you **must** move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to `next`.
*   The game ends when you reach the square `n<sup>2</sup>`.

A board square on row `r` and column `c` has a snake or ladder if `board[r][c] != -1`. The destination of that snake or ladder is `board[r][c]`. Squares `1` and `n<sup>2</sup>` do not have a snake or ladder.

Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move. If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do **not** follow the subsequent snake or ladder.

*   For example, suppose the board is `[[-1,4],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move, your destination square is `2`. You follow the ladder to square `3`, but do **not** follow the subsequent ladder to `4`.

Return _the least number of moves required to reach the square_ `n<sup>2</sup>`_. If it is not possible to reach the square, return_ `-1`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/09/23/snakes.png)

```
Input: board = [[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
Output: 4
Explanation:
In the beginning, you start at square 1 (at row 5, column 0).
You decide to move to square 2 and must take the ladder to square 15.
You then decide to move to square 17 and must take the snake to square 13.
You then decide to move to square 14 and must take the ladder to square 35.
You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.
This is the lowest possible number of moves to reach the last square, so return 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: board = [[-1,-1],[-1,3]]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == board.length == board[i].length`
*   `2 <= n <= 20`
*   `grid[i][j]` is either `-1` or in the range `[1, n<sup>2</sup>]`.
*   The squares labeled `1` and `n<sup>2</sup>` do not have any ladders or snakes.

Let's play the minesweeper game (, )!

You are given an `m x n` char matrix `board` representing the game board where:

*   `'M'` represents an unrevealed mine,
*   `'E'` represents an unrevealed empty square,
*   `'B'` represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent mines (i.e., above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals),
*   digit (`'1'` to `'8'`) represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and
*   `'X'` represents a revealed mine.

You are also given an integer array `click` where `click = [click<sub style="display: inline;">r</sub>, click<sub style="display: inline;">c</sub>]` represents the next click position among all the unrevealed squares (`'M'` or `'E'`).

Return _the board after revealing this position according to the following rules_:

1.  If a mine `'M'` is revealed, then the game is over. You should change it to `'X'`.
2.  If an empty square `'E'` with no adjacent mines is revealed, then change it to a revealed blank `'B'` and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.
3.  If an empty square `'E'` with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, then change it to a digit (`'1'` to `'8'`) representing the number of adjacent mines.
4.  Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return _the maximum **area** of an island in_ `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/maxarea1-grid.jpg)

Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]

### [129\. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/tree/), [Depth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/depth-first-search/), [Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-tree/)


You are given the `root` of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

*   For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.

Return _the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers_. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/num1tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/num2tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
*   The depth of the tree will not exceed `10`.

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Depth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/depth-first-search/), [Breadth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/breadth-first-search/), [Union Find](https://leetcode.com/tag/union-find/), [Matrix](https://leetcode.com/tag/matrix/)


Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, _capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by_ `'X'`.

A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/xogrid.jpg)

```
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Explanation: Surrounded regions should not be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: board = [["X"]]
Output: [["X"]]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`

Related Topics: [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Backtracking](https://leetcode.com/tag/backtracking/)


A **valid IP address** consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between `0` and `255` (**inclusive**) and cannot have leading zeros.

*   For example, `"0.1.2.201"` and `"192.168.1.1"` are **valid** IP addresses, but `"0.011.255.245"`, `"192.168.1.312"` and `"192.168@1.1"` are **invalid** IP addresses.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return _all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into_ `s`. You are **not** allowed to reorder or remove any digits in `s`. You may return the valid IP addresses in **any** order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "25525511135"
Output: ["255.255.11.135","255.255.111.35"]

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Backtracking](https://leetcode.com/tag/backtracking/)


Given an array of **distinct** integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return _a list of all **unique combinations** of_ `candidates` _where the chosen numbers sum to_ `target`_._ You may return the combinations in **any order**.

The **same** number may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

It is **guaranteed** that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7\. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
Output: []
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: candidates = [1], target = 1
Output: [[1]]
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: candidates = [1], target = 2
Output: [[1,1]]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= candidates.length <= 30`
*   `1 <= candidates[i] <= 200`
*   All elements of `candidates` are **distinct**.
*   `1 <= target <= 500`

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/), [Backtracking](https://leetcode.com/tag/backtracking/)


You would like to make dessert and are preparing to buy the ingredients. You have `n` ice cream base flavors and `m` types of toppings to choose from. You must follow these rules when making your dessert:

*   There must be **exactly one** ice cream base.
*   You can add **one or more** types of topping or have no toppings at all.
*   There are **at most two** of **each type** of topping.

You are given three inputs:

*   `baseCosts`, an integer array of length `n`, where each `baseCosts[i]` represents the price of the `i<sup>th</sup>` ice cream base flavor.
*   `toppingCosts`, an integer array of length `m`, where each `toppingCosts[i]` is the price of **one** of the `i<sup>th</sup>` topping.
*   `target`, an integer representing your target price for dessert.

You want to make a dessert with a total cost as close to `target` as possible.

Return _the closest possible cost of the dessert to_ `target`. If there are multiple, return _the **lower** one._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: baseCosts = [1,7], toppingCosts = [3,4], target = 10
Output: 10
Explanation: Consider the following combination (all 0-indexed):
- Choose base 1: cost 7
- Take 1 of topping 0: cost 1 x 3 = 3
- Take 0 of topping 1: cost 0 x 4 = 0
Total: 7 + 3 + 0 = 10.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: baseCosts = [2,3], toppingCosts = [4,5,100], target = 18
Output: 17
Explanation: Consider the following combination (all 0-indexed):
- Choose base 1: cost 3
- Take 1 of topping 0: cost 1 x 4 = 4
- Take 2 of topping 1: cost 2 x 5 = 10
- Take 0 of topping 2: cost 0 x 100 = 0
Total: 3 + 4 + 10 + 0 = 17\. You cannot make a dessert with a total cost of 18.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: baseCosts = [3,10], toppingCosts = [2,5], target = 9
Output: 8
Explanation: It is possible to make desserts with cost 8 and 10\. Return 8 as it is the lower cost.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == baseCosts.length`
*   `m == toppingCosts.length`
*   `1 <= n, m <= 10`
*   `1 <= baseCosts[i], toppingCosts[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>`

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Backtracking](https://leetcode.com/tag/backtracking/)


You are given a string `s` that consists of only digits.

Check if we can split `s` into **two or more non-empty substrings** such that the **numerical values** of the substrings are in **descending order** and the **difference** between numerical values of every two **adjacent** **substrings** is equal to `1`.

*   For example, the string `s = "0090089"` can be split into `["0090", "089"]` with numerical values `[90,89]`. The values are in descending order and adjacent values differ by `1`, so this way is valid.
*   Another example, the string `s = "001"` can be split into `["0", "01"]`, `["00", "1"]`, or `["0", "0", "1"]`. However all the ways are invalid because they have numerical values `[0,1]`, `[0,1]`, and `[0,0,1]` respectively, all of which are not in descending order.

Return `true` _if it is possible to split_ `s`​​​​​​ _as described above__, or_ `false` _otherwise._

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "1234"
Output: false
Explanation: There is no valid way to split s.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "050043"
Output: true
Explanation: s can be split into ["05", "004", "3"] with numerical values [5,4,3].
The values are in descending order with adjacent values differing by 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "9080701"
Output: false
Explanation: There is no valid way to split s.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 20`
*   `s` only consists of digits.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def splitString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str

I think that the worst time complexitiy is O(n*2^n). Because for each bucket, we have to check whether one specific subset of the nums array can be put into it. But as we have visited some of the numbers, and doing some optimization, like sorting the array or pruning, the time complexitiy will be much smaller than the worst case.

### [332\. Reconstruct Itinerary :rainbow:](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/)

Difficulty: **Hard**  

Related Topics: [Depth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/depth-first-search/), [Graph](https://leetcode.com/tag/graph/), [Eulerian Circuit](https://leetcode.com/tag/eulerian-circuit/)


You are given a list of airline `tickets` where `tickets[i] = [from<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, to<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>]` represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.

All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `"JFK"`, thus, the itinerary must begin with `"JFK"`. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.

*   For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.

You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/itinerary1-graph.jpg)

```
Input: tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/itinerary2-graph.jpg)

```
Input: tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"] but it is larger in lexical order.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= tickets.length <= 300`
*   `tickets[i].length == 2`
*   `from<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>.length == 3`
*   `to<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>.length == 3`
*   `from<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` and `to<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` consist of uppercase English letters.

You are given an array of strings `arr`. A string `s` is formed by the **concatenation** of a **subsequence** of `arr` that has **unique characters**.

Return _the **maximum** possible length_ of `s`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = ["un","iq","ue"]
Output: 4
Explanation: All the valid concatenations are:
- ""
- "un"
- "iq"
- "ue"
- "uniq" ("un" + "iq")
- "ique" ("iq" + "ue")
Maximum length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = ["cha","r","act","ers"]
Output: 6
Explanation: Possible longest valid concatenations are "chaers" ("cha" + "ers") and "acters" ("act" + "ers").
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = ["abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"]
Output: 26
Explanation: The only string in arr has all 26 characters.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= arr.length <= 16`

Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

Difficulty: **Hard**  

Related Topics: [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/), [Recursion](https://leetcode.com/tag/recursion/)


Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where:

*   `'.'` Matches any single character.​​​​
*   `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "aab", p = "c*a*b"
Output: true
Explanation: c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. Therefore, it matches "aab".
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: s = "mississippi", p = "mis*is*p*."
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 20`
*   `1 <= p.length <= 30`
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
*   `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'.'`, and `'*'`.
*   It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character `'*'`, there will be a previous valid character to match.

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/)


You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i<sup>th</sup>` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= prices.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>`


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
def maxProfit(prices):
    max_profit = 0
    min_price = prices[0]

### [91\. Decode Ways :rainbow:](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/)


A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be **encoded** into numbers using the following mapping:

```
'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
```

To **decode** an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `"11106"` can be mapped into:

*   `"AAJF"` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
*   `"KJF"` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`

Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `"06"` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `"6"` is different from `"06"`.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return _the **number** of ways to **decode** it_.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "0"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no character that is mapped to a number starting with 0.
The only valid mappings with 0 are 'J' -> "10" and 'T' -> "20", neither of which start with 0.
Hence, there are no valid ways to decode this since all digits need to be mapped.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06").
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
*   `s` contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).

Given an array `nums` of integers, return the **length** of the longest arithmetic subsequence in `nums`.

Recall that a _subsequence_ of an array `nums` is a list `nums[i<sub style="display: inline;">1</sub>], nums[i<sub style="display: inline;">2</sub>], ..., nums[i<sub style="display: inline;">k</sub>]` with `0 <= i<sub style="display: inline;">1</sub> < i<sub style="display: inline;">2</sub> < ... < i<sub style="display: inline;">k</sub> <= nums.length - 1`, and that a sequence `seq` is _arithmetic_ if `seq[i+1] - seq[i]` are all the same value (for `0 <= i < seq.length - 1`).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,6,9,12]
Output: 4
Explanation:
The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with steps of length = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [9,4,7,2,10]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The longest arithmetic subsequence is [4,7,10].

Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for `'?'` and `'*'` where:

*   `'?'` Matches any single character.
*   `'*'` Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aa", p = "*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' matches any sequence.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "cb", p = "?a"
Output: false
Explanation: '?' matches 'c', but the second letter is 'a', which does not match 'b'.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "adceb", p = "*a*b"
Output: true
Explanation: The first '*' matches the empty sequence, while the second '*' matches the substring "dce".
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: s = "acdcb", p = "a*c?b"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length, p.length <= 2000`

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/)


You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `i<sup>th</sup>` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return _the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: cost = [10,15,20]
Output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.

There is a row of `n` houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x 3` cost matrix `costs`.

*   For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with the color red; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...

Return _the minimum cost to paint all houses_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: costs = [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: costs = [[7,6,2]]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

*   `costs.length == n`
*   `costs[i].length == 3`
*   `1 <= n <= 100`
*   `1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20`


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

Related Topics: [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/)


Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return _the length of their longest **common subsequence**._ If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

*   For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
*   `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.

### [983\. Minimum Cost For Tickets :rainbow:](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-tickets/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/)


You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in which you will travel are given as an integer array `days`. Each day is an integer from `1` to `365`.

Train tickets are sold in **three different ways**:

*   a **1-day** pass is sold for `costs[0]` dollars,
*   a **7-day** pass is sold for `costs[1]` dollars, and
*   a **30-day** pass is sold for `costs[2]` dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.

*   For example, if we get a **7-day** pass on day `2`, then we can travel for `7` days: `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, and `8`.

Return _the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total, you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total, you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= days.length <= 365`
*   `1 <= days[i] <= 365`
*   `days` is in strictly increasing order.
*   `costs.length == 3`
*   `1 <= costs[i] <= 1000`

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/)


You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.

### [115\. Distinct Subsequences :rainbow:](https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/)

Difficulty: **Hard**  

Related Topics: [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/)


Given two strings `s` and `t`, return _the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t`_.

A string's **subsequence** is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the remaining characters' relative positions. (i.e., `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not).

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
rabbbit
rabbbit
rabbbit
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000`
*   `s` and `t` consist of English letters.

Difficulty: **Hard**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/)


You are given `n` balloons, indexed from `0` to `n - 1`. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array `nums`. You are asked to burst all the balloons.

If you burst the `i<sup>th</sup>` balloon, you will get `nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1]` coins. If `i - 1` or `i + 1` goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a `1` painted on it.

Return _the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,1,5,8]
Output: 167
Explanation:
nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] --> [3,8] --> [8] --> []
coins =  3*1*5    +   3*5*8   +  1*3*8  + 1*8*1 = 167

The chess knight has a **unique movement**, it may move two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically (with both forming the shape of an **L**). The possible movements of chess knight are shown in this diagaram:

A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/18/chess.jpg)

We have a chess knight and a phone pad as shown below, the knight **can only stand on a numeric cell** (i.e. blue cell).

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/18/phone.jpg)

Given an integer `n`, return how many distinct phone numbers of length `n` we can dial.

You are allowed to place the knight **on any numeric cell** initially and then you should perform `n - 1` jumps to dial a number of length `n`. All jumps should be **valid** knight jumps.

As the answer may be very large, **return the answer modulo** `10<sup>9</sup> + 7`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 10
Explanation: We need to dial a number of length 1, so placing the knight over any numeric cell of the 10 cells is sufficient.
```

**Example 2:**

### [341\. Flatten Nested List Iterator](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-nested-list-iterator/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Stack](https://leetcode.com/tag/stack/), [Tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/tree/), [Depth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/depth-first-search/), [Design](https://leetcode.com/tag/design/), [Queue](https://leetcode.com/tag/queue/), [Iterator](https://leetcode.com/tag/iterator/)


You are given a nested list of integers `nestedList`. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists. Implement an iterator to flatten it.

Implement the `NestedIterator` class:

*   `NestedIterator(List<NestedInteger> nestedList)` Initializes the iterator with the nested list `nestedList`.
*   `int next()` Returns the next integer in the nested list.
*   `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there are still some integers in the nested list and `false` otherwise.

Your code will be tested with the following pseudocode:

```
initialize iterator with nestedList
res = []
while iterator.hasNext()
    append iterator.next() to the end of res
return res
```

If `res` matches the expected flattened list, then your code will be judged as correct.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nestedList = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,1,1]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nestedList = [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: [1,4,6]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nestedList.length <= 500`
*   The values of the integers in the nested list is in the range `[-10<sup>6</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup>]`.

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Math](https://leetcode.com/tag/math/), [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/), [Recursion](https://leetcode.com/tag/recursion/), [Game Theory](https://leetcode.com/tag/game-theory/)


You are given an integer array `nums`. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of `0`. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., `nums[0]` or `nums[nums.length - 1]`) which reduces the size of the array by `1`. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return `true` if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return `true`. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2\.
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5\. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2).
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5\.
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,233,7]
Output: true
Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1\. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7\. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.
```

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`.

You want to build an **expression** out of nums by adding one of the symbols `'+'` and `'-'` before each integer in nums and then concatenate all the integers.

*   For example, if `nums = [2, 1]`, you can add a `'+'` before `2` and a `'-'` before `1` and concatenate them to build the expression `"+2-1"`.

Return the number of different **expressions** that you can build, which evaluates to `target`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
-1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
+1 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
+1 + 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
+1 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 3
+1 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1], target = 1
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 20`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

In the "100 game" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from `1` to `10`. The player who first causes the running total to **reach or exceed** 100 wins.

What if we change the game so that players **cannot** re-use integers?

For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.

Given two integers `maxChoosableInteger` and `desiredTotal`, return `true` if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return `false`. Assume both players play **optimally**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11
Output: false
Explanation:
No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 0
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 1
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= maxChoosableInteger <= 20`
*   `0 <= desiredTotal <= 300`


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
def canIWin(maxChoosableInteger, desiredTotal):

        # if the largest choice exceeds the remainder, then we can win!
        if choices[-1] >= remainder:
            return True

        # if we have seen this exact scenario play out, then we know the outcome

        return False

    seen = {}

    # let's do some quick checks before we journey through the tree of permutations
    summed_choices = (maxChoosableInteger + 1) * maxChoosableInteger / 2

    # if all the choices added up are less then the total, no-one can win
    if summed_choices < desiredTotal:
        return False

    # if the sum matches desiredTotal exactly then you win if there's an odd number of turns

### [688\. Knight Probability in Chessboard](https://leetcode.com/problems/knight-probability-in-chessboard/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/)


On an `n x n` chessboard, a knight starts at the cell `(row, column)` and attempts to make exactly `k` moves. The rows and columns are **0-indexed**, so the top-left cell is `(0, 0)`, and the bottom-right cell is `(n - 1, n - 1)`.

A chess knight has eight possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two cells in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/knight.png)

Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there.

The knight continues moving until it has made exactly `k` moves or has moved off the chessboard.

Return _the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped moving_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, k = 2, row = 0, column = 0
Output: 0.06250
Explanation: There are two moves (to (1,2), (2,1)) that will keep the knight on the board.
From each of those positions, there are also two moves that will keep the knight on the board.
The total probability the knight stays on the board is 0.0625.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1, k = 0, row = 0, column = 0
Output: 1.00000
```

### [1770\. Maximum Score from Performing Multiplication Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-performing-multiplication-operations/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/)


You are given two integer arrays `nums` and `multipliers`of size `n` and `m` respectively, where `n >= m`. The arrays are **1-indexed**.

You begin with a score of `0`. You want to perform **exactly** `m` operations. On the `i<sup>th</sup>` operation **(1-indexed)**, you will:

*   Choose one integer `x` from **either the start or the end** of the array `nums`.
*   Add `multipliers[i] * x` to your score.
*   Remove `x` from the array `nums`.

Return _the **maximum** score after performing_ `m` _operations._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], multipliers = [3,2,1]
Output: 14
Explanation: An optimal solution is as follows:
- Choose from the end, [1,2,3], adding 3 * 3 = 9 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [1,2], adding 2 * 2 = 4 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [1], adding 1 * 1 = 1 to the score.
The total score is 9 + 4 + 1 = 14.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], multipliers = [-10,-5,3,4,6]
Output: 102
Explanation: An optimal solution is as follows:
- Choose from the start, [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -5 * -10 = 50 to the score.
- Choose from the start, [-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * -5 = 15 to the score.
- Choose from the start, [-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * 3 = -9 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [-2,7,1], adding 1 * 4 = 4 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [-2,7], adding 7 * 6 = 42 to the score.
The total score is 50 + 15 - 9 + 4 + 42 = 102.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `m == multipliers.length`
*   `1 <= m <= 10<sup>3</sup>`
*   `m <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `-1000 <= nums[i], multipliers[i] <= 1000`


#### Solution

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/)


Given a `triangle` array, return _the minimum path sum from top to bottom_.

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index `i` on the current row, you may move to either index `i` or index `i + 1` on the next row.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: triangle = [[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]]
Output: 11
Explanation: The triangle looks like:
   2
  3 4
 6 5 7
4 1 8 3
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11 (underlined above).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: triangle = [[-10]]
Output: -10
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= triangle.length <= 200`
*   `triangle[0].length == 1`
*   `triangle[i].length == triangle[i - 1].length + 1`
*   `-10<sup>4</sup> <= triangle[i][j] <= 10<sup>4</sup>`

**Follow up:** Could you do this using only `O(n)` extra space, where `n` is the total number of rows in the triangle?

#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumTotal(self, triangle: List[List[int]]) -> int:

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i<sup>th</sup>` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

*   After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0

### [1911\. Maximum Alternating Subsequence Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-alternating-subsequence-sum/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/)


The **alternating sum** of a **0-indexed** array is defined as the **sum** of the elements at **even** indices **minus** the **sum** of the elements at **odd** indices.

*   For example, the alternating sum of `[4,2,5,3]` is `(4 + 5) - (2 + 3) = 4`.

Given an array `nums`, return _the **maximum alternating sum** of any subsequence of_ `nums` _(after **reindexing** the elements of the subsequence)_.

A **subsequence** of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. For example, `[2,7,4]` is a subsequence of `[4,<u style="display: inline;">2</u>,3,<u style="display: inline;">7</u>,2,1,<u style="display: inline;">4</u>]` (the underlined elements), while `[2,4,2]` is not.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,2,5,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: It is optimal to choose the subsequence [4,2,5] with alternating sum (4 + 5) - 2 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [5,6,7,8]
Output: 8
Explanation: It is optimal to choose the subsequence [8] with alternating sum 8.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [6,2,1,2,4,5]
Output: 10
Explanation: It is optimal to choose the subsequence [6,1,5] with alternating sum (6 + 5) - 1 = 10.
```

There are `n` oranges in the kitchen and you decided to eat some of these oranges every day as follows:

*   Eat one orange.
*   If the number of remaining oranges `n` is divisible by `2` then you can eat `n / 2` oranges.
*   If the number of remaining oranges `n` is divisible by `3` then you can eat `2 * (n / 3)` oranges.

You can only choose one of the actions per day.

Given the integer `n`, return _the minimum number of days to eat_ `n` _oranges_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: You have 10 oranges.
Day 1: Eat 1 orange,  10 - 1 = 9\.  
Day 2: Eat 6 oranges, 9 - 2*(9/3) = 9 - 6 = 3\. (Since 9 is divisible by 3)
Day 3: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1\.
Day 4: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.
You need at least 4 days to eat the 10 oranges.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: You have 6 oranges.
Day 1: Eat 3 oranges, 6 - 6/2 = 6 - 3 = 3\. (Since 6 is divisible by 2).
Day 2: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1\. (Since 3 is divisible by 3)
Day 3: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.

Given an integer array `nums` with possible **duplicates**, randomly output the index of a given `target` number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.

Implement the `Solution` class:

*   `Solution(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the array `nums`.
*   `int pick(int target)` Picks a random index `i` from `nums` where `nums[i] == target`. If there are multiple valid i's, then each index should have an equal probability of returning.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["Solution", "pick", "pick", "pick"]
[[[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]], [3], [1], [3]]
Output
[null, 4, 0, 2]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 2, 3, 3, 3]);
solution.pick(3); // It should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
solution.pick(1); // It should return 0\. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
solution.pick(3); // It should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `-2<sup>31</sup> <= nums[i] <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1`
*   `target` is an integer from `nums`.
*   At most `10<sup>4</sup>` calls will be made to `pick`.

Related Topics: [Math](https://leetcode.com/tag/math/), [Brainteaser](https://leetcode.com/tag/brainteaser/)


There are `n` bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs, then you turn off every second bulb.

On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the `i<sup>th</sup>` round, you toggle every `i` bulb. For the `n<sup>th</sup>` round, you only toggle the last bulb.

Return _the number of bulbs that are on after `n` rounds_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/bulb.jpg)

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
After the first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After the second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After the third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off].
So you should return 1 because there is only one bulb is on.
```

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/), [Math](https://leetcode.com/tag/math/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/)


Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

*   `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
*   `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
*   `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

Return `true` if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: instructions = "GGLLGG"
Output: true
Explanation: The robot moves from (0,0) to (0,2), turns 180 degrees, and then returns to (0,0).
When repeating these instructions, the robot remains in the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: instructions = "GG"
Output: false
Explanation: The robot moves north indefinitely.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: instructions = "GL"
Output: true
Explanation: The robot moves from (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (-1, 1) -> (-1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> ...
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= instructions.length <= 100`
*   `instructions[i]` is `'G'`, `'L'` or, `'R'`.

You are given a stream of points on the X-Y plane. Design an algorithm that:

*   **Adds** new points from the stream into a data structure. **Duplicate** points are allowed and should be treated as different points.
*   Given a query point, **counts** the number of ways to choose three points from the data structure such that the three points and the query point form an **axis-aligned square** with **positive area**.

An **axis-aligned square** is a square whose edges are all the same length and are either parallel or perpendicular to the x-axis and y-axis.

Implement the `DetectSquares` class:

*   `DetectSquares()` Initializes the object with an empty data structure.
*   `void add(int[] point)` Adds a new point `point = [x, y]` to the data structure.
*   `int count(int[] point)` Counts the number of ways to form **axis-aligned squares** with point `point = [x, y]` as described above.

detectSquares.count([14, 8]);  // return 0\. The query point cannot form a square with any points in the data structure.
detectSquares.add([11, 2]);    // Adding duplicate points is allowed.
detectSquares.count([11, 10]); // return 2\. You can choose:
                               //   - The first, second, and third points

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "bb"
Output: 1
Explanation: An optimal solution is to choose "b" (the first character) for the 1st subsequence and "b" (the second character) for the 2nd subsequence.
The product of their lengths is: 1 * 1 = 1.

_(This problem is an **interactive problem**.)_

A **row-sorted binary matrix** means that all elements are `0` or `1` and each row of the matrix is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given a **row-sorted binary matrix** `binaryMatrix`, return _the index (0-indexed) of the **leftmost column** with a 1 in it_. If such an index does not exist, return `-1`.

**You can't access the Binary Matrix directly.** You may only access the matrix using a `BinaryMatrix` interface:

*   `BinaryMatrix.get(row, col)` returns the element of the matrix at index `(row, col)` (0-indexed).
*   `BinaryMatrix.dimensions()` returns the dimensions of the matrix as a list of 2 elements `[rows, cols]`, which means the matrix is `rows x cols`.

Submissions making more than `1000` calls to `BinaryMatrix.get` will be judged _Wrong Answer_. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

For custom testing purposes, the input will be the entire binary matrix `mat`. You will not have access to the binary matrix directly.

An array is **monotonic** if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.

An array `nums` is monotone increasing if for all `i <= j`, `nums[i] <= nums[j]`. An array `nums` is monotone decreasing if for all `i <= j`, `nums[i] >= nums[j]`.

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` _if the given array is monotonic, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [6,5,4,4]

Assume the following rules are for the tic-tac-toe game on an `n x n` board between two players:

1.  A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
2.  Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves are allowed.
3.  A player who succeeds in placing `n` of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Implement the `TicTacToe` class:

*   `TicTacToe(int n)` Initializes the object the size of the board `n`.
*   `int move(int row, int col, int player)` Indicates that the player with id `player` plays at the cell `(row, col)` of the board. The move is guaranteed to be a valid move.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["TicTacToe", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move"]
[[3], [0, 0, 1], [0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2], [2, 1, 1]]
Output
[null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

Explanation
TicTacToe ticTacToe = new TicTacToe(3);
Assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.
ticTacToe.move(0, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

ticTacToe.move(0, 2, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

ticTacToe.move(2, 2, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

ticTacToe.move(1, 1, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

ticTacToe.move(2, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

ticTacToe.move(1, 0, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).

```

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 100`
*   player is `1` or `2`.
*   `0 <= row, col < n`
*   `(row, col)` are **unique** for each different call to `move`.
*   At most `n<sup>2</sup>` calls will be made to `move`.

**Follow-up:** Could you do better than `O(n<sup>2</sup>)` per `move()` operation?


#### Solution

At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships (i.e., there are no adjacent battleships).

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/10/battelship-grid.jpg)

```
Input: board = [["X",".",".","X"],[".",".",".","X"],[".",".",".","X"]]

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/)


Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest **continuous increasing subsequence** (i.e. subarray)_. The subsequence must be **strictly** increasing.

A **continuous increasing subsequence** is defined by two indices `l` and `r` (`l < r`) such that it is `[nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]]` and for each `l <= i < r`, `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5] with length 3.
Even though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element
4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2] with length 1\. Note that it must be strictly
increasing.
```

### [152\. Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/)


Given an integer array `nums`, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return _the product_.

It is **guaranteed** that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

A **subarray** is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
*   The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
def maxProduct(nums):
    positive_max, negative_max = nums[0], nums[0]
    result = nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]:
        positive_max, negative_max = max(num, positive_max * num, negative_max * num), min(num, positive_max * num, negative_max * num)
        result = max(result, positive_max)
    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    maxProduct([-4,-3,-2])
    maxProduct([2,3,-2,-4])

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Greedy](https://leetcode.com/tag/greedy/)


You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent** plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return _if_ `n` new flowers can be planted in the `flowerbed` without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.
*   There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`.
*   `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
flowerbed = [1,0]; n = 1
def canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed, n):
    flowerbed.append(0)
    flowerbed.insert(0, 0)
    size = len(flowerbed)

### [289\. Game of Life :fire:](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Matrix](https://leetcode.com/tag/matrix/), [Simulation](https://leetcode.com/tag/simulation/)


According to : "The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: **live** (represented by a `1`) or **dead** (represented by a `0`). Each cell interacts with its (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return _the next state_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/26/grid1.jpg)

```
Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/26/grid2.jpg)

```
Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 25`
*   `board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

**Follow up:**

*   Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
*   In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?


#### Solution

Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1.  Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2.  Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3.  Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

**Note:**

*   A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
*   Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

### [228\. Summary Ranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/summary-ranges/)

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/)


You are given a **sorted unique** integer array `nums`.

Return _the **smallest sorted** list of ranges that **cover all the numbers in the array exactly**_. That is, each element of `nums` is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer `x` such that `x` is in one of the ranges but not in `nums`.

Each range `[a,b]` in the list should be output as:

*   `"a->b"` if `a != b`
*   `"a"` if `a == b`

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,2,4,5,7]
Output: ["0->2","4->5","7"]
Explanation: The ranges are:
[0,2] --> "0->2"
[4,5] --> "4->5"
[7,7] --> "7"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,2,3,4,6,8,9]
Output: ["0","2->4","6","8->9"]
Explanation: The ranges are:
[0,0] --> "0"
[2,4] --> "2->4"
[6,6] --> "6"
[8,9] --> "8->9"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = []
Output: []
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: nums = [-1]
Output: ["-1"]
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: ["0"]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums.length <= 20`
*   `-2<sup>31</sup> <= nums[i] <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1`
*   All the values of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is sorted in ascending order.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
def summaryRanges(self, nums):
    if not nums:
        return []
    res, i, start = [], 0, 0
    while i < len(nums)-1:
        if nums[i]+1 != nums[i+1]:
            res.append(self.printRange(nums[start], nums[i]))
            start = i+1
        i += 1
    res.append(self.printRange(nums[start], nums[i]))
    return res

def printRange(self, l, r):
    if l == r:
        return str(l)
    else:
        return str(l) + "->" + str(r)

Output: 4
Explanation: The pairs with an absolute difference of 1 are:
- [1,2,2,1]
- [1,2,2,1]
- [1,2,2,1]
- [1,2,2,1]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3], k = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no pairs with an absolute difference of 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,4], k = 2

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Matrix](https://leetcode.com/tag/matrix/), [Prefix Sum](https://leetcode.com/tag/prefix-sum/)


You are given a **0-indexed** 2D array `grid` of size `2 x n`, where `grid[r][c]` represents the number of points at position `(r, c)` on the matrix. Two robots are playing a game on this matrix.

Both robots initially start at `(0, 0)` and want to reach `(1, n-1)`. Each robot may only move to the **right** (`(r, c)` to `(r, c + 1)`) or **down** (`(r, c)` to `(r + 1, c)`).

At the start of the game, the **first** robot moves from `(0, 0)` to `(1, n-1)`, collecting all the points from the cells on its path. For all cells `(r, c)` traversed on the path, `grid[r][c]` is set to `0`. Then, the **second** robot moves from `(0, 0)` to `(1, n-1)`, collecting the points on its path. Note that their paths may intersect with one another.

The **first** robot wants to **minimize** the number of points collected by the **second** robot. In contrast, the **second** robot wants to **maximize** the number of points it collects. If both robots play **optimally**, return _the **number of points** collected by the **second** robot._

**Example 1:**

### [362\. Design Hit Counter :rainbow:](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hit-counter/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/), [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-search/), [Design](https://leetcode.com/tag/design/), [Queue](https://leetcode.com/tag/queue/)


Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past `5` minutes (i.e., the past `300` seconds).

Your system should accept a `timestamp` parameter (**in seconds** granularity), and you may assume that calls are being made to the system in chronological order (i.e., `timestamp` is monotonically increasing). Several hits may arrive roughly at the same time.

Implement the `HitCounter` class:

*   `HitCounter()` Initializes the object of the hit counter system.
*   `void hit(int timestamp)` Records a hit that happened at `timestamp` (**in seconds**). Several hits may happen at the same `timestamp`.
*   `int getHits(int timestamp)` Returns the number of hits in the past 5 minutes from `timestamp` (i.e., the past `300` seconds).

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["HitCounter", "hit", "hit", "hit", "getHits", "hit", "getHits", "getHits"]
[[], [1], [2], [3], [4], [300], [300], [301]]
Output
[null, null, null, null, 3, null, 4, 3]

Explanation
HitCounter hitCounter = new HitCounter();
hitCounter.hit(1);       // hit at timestamp 1.
hitCounter.hit(2);       // hit at timestamp 2.
hitCounter.hit(3);       // hit at timestamp 3.
hitCounter.getHits(4);   // get hits at timestamp 4, return 3.
hitCounter.hit(300);     // hit at timestamp 300.
hitCounter.getHits(300); // get hits at timestamp 300, return 4.
hitCounter.getHits(301); // get hits at timestamp 301, return 3.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= timestamp <= 2 * 10<sup>9</sup>`
*   All the calls are being made to the system in chronological order (i.e., `timestamp` is monotonically increasing).
*   At most `300` calls will be made to `hit` and `getHits`.

**Follow up:** What if the number of hits per second could be huge? Does your design scale?

        while self.counter and timestamp -self.counter[0] >= 300:

```
* [复杂度](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hit-counter/discuss/83511/Python-solution-with-detailed-explanation)
* The third solution creates an array of 300 elements. Every element of the array comprises of `[frequency, timestamp]`.
* Timestamp 1 maps to index 0. Timestamp 100 maps to index 99.
* Use modulo mathematics to update it. hit: O(1). get_hit: O(300). This solution will scale perfectly!

```Python
class HitCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hits = [(0, 0)] * 300

    def hit(self, timestamp: int) -> None:
        i = (timestamp-1) % 300
        t, c = self.hits[i]

        if timestamp - t < 300:
            self.hits[i] = (timestamp, c+1)
        else:
            self.hits[i] = (timestamp, 1)

    def getHits(self, timestamp: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        for t, c in self.hits:

Design a phone directory that initially has `maxNumbers` empty slots that can store numbers. The directory should store numbers, check if a certain slot is empty or not, and empty a given slot.

Implement the `PhoneDirectory` class:

*   `PhoneDirectory(int maxNumbers)` Initializes the phone directory with the number of available slots `maxNumbers`.
*   `int get()` Provides a number that is not assigned to anyone. Returns `-1` if no number is available.
*   `bool check(int number)` Returns `true` if the slot `number` is available and `false` otherwise.
*   `void release(int number)` Recycles or releases the slot `number`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["PhoneDirectory", "get", "get", "check", "get", "check", "release", "check"]
[[3], [], [], [2], [], [2], [2], [2]]
Output
[null, 0, 1, true, 2, false, null, true]

Explanation
PhoneDirectory phoneDirectory = new PhoneDirectory(3);
phoneDirectory.get();      // It can return any available phone number. Here we assume it returns 0.
phoneDirectory.get();      // Assume it returns 1.
phoneDirectory.check(2);   // The number 2 is available, so return true.
phoneDirectory.get();      // It returns 2, the only number that is left.
phoneDirectory.check(2);   // The number 2 is no longer available, so return false.
phoneDirectory.release(2); // Release number 2 back to the pool.
phoneDirectory.check(2);   // Number 2 is available again, return true.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= maxNumbers <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `0 <= number < maxNumbers`
*   At most `2 * 10<sup>4</sup>` calls will be made to `get`, `check`, and `release`.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
class PhoneDirectory:
​
    def __init__(self, maxNumbers: int):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here
        @param maxNumbers - The maximum numbers that can be stored in the phone directory.
        """
        self.maxnums = maxNumbers
        self.nums = collections.deque([])
        for elt in range(self.maxnums):
            self.nums.append(elt)
        self.count = collections.Counter(self.nums)

​
    def get(self) -> int:
        """
        Provide a number which is not assigned to anyone.
        @return - Return an available number. Return -1 if none is available.
        """
        if self.nums:
            num = self.nums.popleft()
            self.count[num] -= 1
            return num
        else:
            return -1


​
    def check(self, number: int) -> bool:
        """
        Check if a number is available or not.
        """
        if number in self.count and self.count[number] > 0:
            return True
        return False

​
    def release(self, number: int) -> None:
        """
        Recycle or release a number.
        """
        if number not in self.count or self.count[number] == 0:
            self.nums.append(number)
            self.count[number] += 1

### [1249\. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-remove-to-make-valid-parentheses/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Stack](https://leetcode.com/tag/stack/)


Given a string <font face="monospace" style="display: inline;">s</font> of `'('` , `')'` and lowercase English characters.

Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( `'('` or `')'`, in any positions ) so that the resulting _parentheses string_ is valid and return **any** valid string.

Formally, a _parentheses string_ is valid if and only if:

*   It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
*   It can be written as `AB` (`A` concatenated with `B`), where `A` and `B` are valid strings, or
*   It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a valid string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "lee(t(c)o)de)"
Output: "lee(t(c)o)de"
Explanation: "lee(t(co)de)" , "lee(t(c)ode)" would also be accepted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "a)b(c)d"
Output: "ab(c)d"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "))(("
Output: ""
Explanation: An empty string is also valid.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "(a(b(c)d)"
Output: "a(b(c)d)"
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `s[i]` is either`'('` , `')'`, or lowercase English letter`.`


#### Solution

    dict_use = {}
    for i, chr in enumerate(s):
        if chr == '(':
            stack.append(i)

### [636\. Exclusive Time of Functions](https://leetcode.com/problems/exclusive-time-of-functions/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Stack](https://leetcode.com/tag/stack/)


On a **single-threaded** CPU, we execute a program containing `n` functions. Each function has a unique ID between `0` and `n-1`.

Function calls are **stored in a** : when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is **the current function being executed**. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.

You are given a list `logs`, where `logs[i]` represents the `i<sup>th</sup>` log message formatted as a string `"{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}"`. For example, `"0:start:3"` means a function call with function ID `0` **started at the beginning** of timestamp `3`, and `"1:end:2"` means a function call with function ID `1` **ended at the end** of timestamp `2`. Note that a function can be called **multiple times, possibly recursively**.

A function's **exclusive time** is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for `2` time units and another call executing for `1` time unit, the **exclusive time** is `2 + 1 = 3`.

Return _the **exclusive time** of each function in an array, where the value at the_ `i<sup>th</sup>` _index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID_ `i`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/04/05/diag1b.png)

```
Input: n = 2, logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]
Output: [3,4]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1, logs = ["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","0:start:6","0:end:6","0:end:7"]
Output: [8]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.
Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 2, logs = ["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","1:start:6","1:end:6","0:end:7"]
Output: [7,1]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 units of time, and ends at the end of time 6.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: n = 2, logs = ["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","1:start:7","1:end:7","0:end:8"]
Output: [8,1]
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: n = 1, logs = ["0:start:0","0:end:0"]
Output: [1]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 100`
*   `1 <= logs.length <= 500`
*   `0 <= function_id < n`
*   `0 <= timestamp <= 10<sup>9</sup>`
*   No two start events will happen at the same timestamp.
*   No two end events will happen at the same timestamp.
*   Each function has an `"end"` log for each `"start"` log.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
def exclusiveTime(n, logs):
    result = [0] * n
    stack = []
    prev_time = 0
    for log in logs:
        id, type, time = log.split(':')
        if type == 'start':
            if stack:
                result[stack[-1]] += int(time) - prev_time
            stack.append(int(id))
            prev_time = int(time)
        else:
            result[stack[-1]] += int(time) - prev_time + 1
            stack.pop()
            prev_time = int(time) + 1
    return result

exclusiveTime(n = 2, logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"])
exclusiveTime(n = 1, logs = ["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","0:start:6","0:end:6","0:end:7"])
exclusiveTime(n = 2, logs = ["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","1:start:6","1:end:6","0:end:7"])
exclusiveTime(n = 2, logs = ["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","1:start:7","1:end:7","0:end:8"])

### [71\. Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Stack](https://leetcode.com/tag/stack/)


Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

The **canonical path** should have the following format:

*   The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
*   Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
*   The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
*   The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

Return _the simplified **canonical path**_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: path = "/home/"
Output: "/home"
Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: path = "/../"
Output: "/"
Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: path = "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"
Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: path = "/a/./b/../../c/"
Output: "/c"
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= path.length <= 3000`
*   `path` consists of English letters, digits, period `'.'`, slash `'/'` or `'_'`.
*   `path` is a valid absolute Unix path.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
def simplifyPath(path):
    path = path.split('/')
    stack = []
    for s in path:
        if (s == '.') or (s == '') or (not stack and s == '..'):
            continue
        elif s == '..' and stack:
            stack.pop()
        else:
            stack.append(s)
    return '/' + '/'.join(stack)

这道求最长有效括号比之前那道 Valid Parentheses 难度要大一些，这里还是借助栈来求解，需要定义个 start 变量来记录合法括号串的起始位置，遍历字符串，如果遇到左括号，则将当前下标压入栈，如果遇到右括号，如果当前栈为空，则将下一个坐标位置记录到 start，如果栈不为空，则将栈顶元素取出，此时若栈为空，则更新结果和 i - start + 1 中的较大值，否则更新结果和 i - st.top() 中的较大值，参见代码如下：

*   There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
*   Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

solutions:
* 如果当前是数字，那么更新计算当前数字；
* 如果当前是操作符+或者-，那么需要更新计算当前计算的结果res，并把当前数字num设为0，sign设为正负，重新开始；
* 如果当前是`(`，那么说明后面的小括号里的内容需要优先计算，所以要把res，sign进栈，更新res和sign为新的开始；
* 如果当前是`)`，那么说明当前括号里的内容已经计算完毕，所以要把之前的结果出栈，然后计算整个式子的结果；
* 最后，当所有数字结束的时候，需要把结果进行计算，确保结果是正确的。
```python
def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        res, num, sign = 0, 0, 1
        stack = []
        for c in s:
            if c.isdigit():
                num = 10 * num + int(c)
            elif c == "+" or c == "-":

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Stack](https://leetcode.com/tag/stack/), [Recursion](https://leetcode.com/tag/recursion/)


Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times. Note that `k` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, `k`. For example, there won't be input like `3a` or `2[4]`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
Output: "aaabcbc"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
Output: "accaccacc"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"
Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "abc3[cd]xyz"
Output: "abccdcdcdxyz"
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 30`
*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and square brackets `'[]'`.
*   `s` is guaranteed to be **a valid** input.
*   All the integers in `s` are in the range `[1, 300]`.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python

### [155\. Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Stack](https://leetcode.com/tag/stack/), [Design](https://leetcode.com/tag/design/)


Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the `MinStack` class:

*   `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
*   `void push(int val)` pushes the element `val` onto the stack.
*   `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
*   `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
*   `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]

Output
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]

Explanation
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2
```

**Constraints:**

*   `-2<sup>31</sup> <= val <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1`
*   Methods `pop`, `top` and `getMin` operations will always be called on **non-empty** stacks.
*   At most `3 * 10<sup>4</sup>` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `getMin`.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
class MinStack(object):

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.minstack = []

    def push(self, number):
        self.stack.append(number)
        if len(self.minstack) == 0 or number <= self.minstack[-1]:

Design a max stack data structure that supports the stack operations and supports finding the stack's maximum element.

Implement the `MaxStack` class:

*   `MaxStack()` Initializes the stack object.
*   `void push(int x)` Pushes element `x` onto the stack.
*   `int pop()` Removes the element on top of the stack and returns it.
*   `int top()` Gets the element on the top of the stack without removing it.
*   `int peekMax()` Retrieves the maximum element in the stack without removing it.
*   `int popMax()` Retrieves the maximum element in the stack and removes it. If there is more than one maximum element, only remove the **top-most** one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["MaxStack", "push", "push", "push", "top", "popMax", "top", "peekMax", "pop", "top"]
[[], [5], [1], [5], [], [], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, null, 5, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5]

Explanation
MaxStack stk = new MaxStack();
stk.push(5);   // [5] the top of the stack and the maximum number is 5.
stk.push(1);   // [5, 1] the top of the stack is 1, but the maximum is 5.
stk.push(5);   // [5, 1, 5] the top of the stack is 5, which is also the maximum, because it is the top most one.
stk.top();     // return 5, [5, 1, 5] the stack did not change.
stk.popMax();  // return 5, [5, 1] the stack is changed now, and the top is different from the max.
stk.top();     // return 1, [5, 1] the stack did not change.
stk.peekMax(); // return 5, [5, 1] the stack did not change.
stk.pop();     // return 1, [5] the top of the stack and the max element is now 5.
stk.top();     // return 5, [5] the stack did not change.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `-10<sup>7</sup> <= x <= 10<sup>7</sup>`
*   At most `10<sup>4</sup>` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, `peekMax`, and `popMax`.
*   There will be **at least one element** in the stack when `pop`, `top`, `peekMax`, or `popMax` is called.

**Follow up:** Could you come up with a solution that supports `O(1)` for each `top` call and `O(logn)` for each other call?

### [388\. Longest Absolute File Path :rainbow:](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-absolute-file-path/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Stack](https://leetcode.com/tag/stack/), [Depth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/depth-first-search/)


Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An example of one system is represented in the following picture:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/mdir.jpg)

Here, we have `dir` as the only directory in the root. `dir` contains two subdirectories, `subdir1` and `subdir2`. `subdir1` contains a file `file1.ext` and subdirectory `subsubdir1`. `subdir2` contains a subdirectory `subsubdir2`, which contains a file `file2.ext`.

In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):

```
dir
⟶ subdir1
⟶ ⟶ file1.ext
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1
⟶ subdir2
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2
⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext
```

If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: `"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"`. Note that the `'\n'` and `'\t'` are the new-line and tab characters.

Every file and directory has a unique **absolute path** in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by `'/'s`. Using the above example, the **absolute path** to `file2.ext` is `"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"`. Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form `name.extension`, where `name` and `extension` consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.

Given a string `input` representing the file system in the explained format, return _the length of the **longest absolute path** to a **file** in the abstracted file system_. If there is no file in the system, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/dir1.jpg)

```
Input: input = "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext"
Output: 20
Explanation: We have only one file, and the absolute path is "dir/subdir2/file.ext" of length 20.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/dir2.jpg)

```
Input: input = "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"
Output: 32
Explanation: We have two files:
"dir/subdir1/file1.ext" of length 21
"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext" of length 32.
We return 32 since it is the longest absolute path to a file.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: input = "a"
Output: 0
Explanation: We do not have any files, just a single directory named "a".
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: input = "file1.txt\nfile2.txt\nlongfile.txt"
Output: 12
Explanation: There are 3 files at the root directory.
Since the absolute path for anything at the root directory is just the name itself, the answer is "longfile.txt" with length 12.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= input.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `input` may contain lowercase or uppercase English letters, a new line character `'\n'`, a tab character `'\t'`, a dot `'.'`, a space `' '`, and digits.

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Stack](https://leetcode.com/tag/stack/)


You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`, a `k` **duplicate removal** consists of choosing `k` adjacent and equal letters from `s` and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make `k` **duplicate removals** on `s` until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation:
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `2 <= k <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `s` only contains lower case English letters.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. A **duplicate removal** consists of choosing two **adjacent** and **equal** letters and removing them.

We repeatedly make **duplicate removals** on `s` until we no longer can.

Return _the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made_. It can be proven that the answer is **unique**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abbaca"
Output: "ca"
Explanation:
For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "azxxzy"
Output: "ay"
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in .

Valid operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

**Note** that division between two integers should truncate toward zero.

It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there will not be any division by zero operation.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]

Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
Output: 22
Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Stack](https://leetcode.com/tag/stack/), [Monotonic Stack](https://leetcode.com/tag/monotonic-stack/)


Given the array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of the `ith` item in a shop. There is a special discount for items in the shop, if you buy the `ith` item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to `prices[j]` where `j` is the **minimum** index such that `j > i` and `prices[j] <= prices[i]`, otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

_Return an array where the `ith` element is the final price you will pay for the `ith` item of the shop considering the special discount._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
Explanation:
For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4.
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2.
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4.
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: In this case, for all items, you will not receive any discount at all.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: prices = [10,1,1,6]
Output: [9,0,1,6]
```

**Constraints:**

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Stack](https://leetcode.com/tag/stack/)


We are given an array `asteroids` of integers representing asteroids in a row.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: asteroids = [5,10,-5]
Output: [5,10]
Explanation: The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10\. The 5 and 10 never collide.

There are `n` cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is `target` miles away.

You are given two integer array `position` and `speed`, both of length `n`, where `position[i]` is the position of the `i<sup>th</sup>` car and `speed[i]` is the speed of the `i<sup>th</sup>` car (in miles per hour).

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper **at the same speed**. The faster car will **slow down** to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).

A **car fleet** is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.

Return _the **number of car fleets** that will arrive at the destination_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6\. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4\. The fleet moves at speed 2.
Then, the fleet (speed 2) and the car starting at 4 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6\. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == position.length == speed.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `0 < target <= 10<sup>6</sup>`
*   `0 <= position[i] < target`
*   All the values of `position` are **unique**.

Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [x<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, y<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `√(x<sub style="display: inline;">1</sub> - x<sub style="display: inline;">2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (y<sub style="display: inline;">1</sub> - y<sub style="display: inline;">2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>`).

You may return the answer in **any order**. The answer is **guaranteed** to be **unique** (except for the order that it is in).

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/03/closestplane1.jpg)

```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= k <= points.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the_ `k` _most frequent elements_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
*   It is **guaranteed** that the answer is **unique**.

**Follow up:** Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than `O(n log n)`, where n is the array's size.

```
Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8
Output: 13
Explanation: The elements in the matrix are [1,5,9,10,11,12,13,13,15], and the 8th smallest number is 13
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = [[-5]], k = 1
Output: -5
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
*   `1 <= n <= 300`
*   `-10<sup>9</sup> <= matrix[i][j] <= 10<sup>9</sup>`
*   All the rows and columns of `matrix` are **guaranteed** to be sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return _the_ `k` _most frequent strings_.

Return the answer **sorted** by **the frequency** from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their **lexicographical order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i","love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= words.length <= 500`
*   `1 <= words[i] <= 10`
*   `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
*   `k` is in the range `[1, The number of **unique** words[i]]`

The **median** is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

*   For example, for `arr = [2,3,4]`, the median is `3`.
*   For example, for `arr = [2,3]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

Implement the MedianFinder class:

*   `MedianFinder()` initializes the `MedianFinder` object.
*   `void addNum(int num)` adds the integer `num` from the data stream to the data structure.
*   `double findMedian()` returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within `10<sup>-5</sup>` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["MedianFinder", "addNum", "addNum", "findMedian", "addNum", "findMedian"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [3], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0]

Explanation
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = [1]
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = [1, 2]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)
medianFinder.addNum(3);    // arr[1, 2, 3]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.0
```

**Constraints:**

*   `-10<sup>5</sup> <= num <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   There will be at least one element in the data structure before calling `findMedian`.
*   At most `5 * 10<sup>4</sup>` calls will be made to `addNum` and `findMedian`.

**Follow up:**

*   If all integer numbers from the stream are in the range `[0, 100]`, how would you optimize your solution?
*   If `99%` of all integer numbers from the stream are in the range `[0, 100]`, how would you optimize your solution?

Difficulty: **Hard**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Sorting](https://leetcode.com/tag/sorting/), [Heap (Priority Queue)](https://leetcode.com/tag/heap-priority-queue/)


We are given a list `schedule` of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.

Each employee has a list of non-overlapping `Intervals`, and these intervals are in sorted order.

Return the list of finite intervals representing **common, positive-length free time** for _all_ employees, also in sorted order.

(Even though we are representing `Intervals` in the form `[x, y]`, the objects inside are `Intervals`, not lists or arrays. For example, `schedule[0][0].start = 1`, `schedule[0][0].end = 2`, and `schedule[0][0][0]` is not defined).  Also, we wouldn't include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
Output: [[3,4]]
Explanation: There are a total of three employees, and all common
free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
Output: [[5,6],[7,9]]

Design a system that manages the reservation state of `n` seats that are numbered from `1` to `n`.

Implement the `SeatManager` class:

*   `SeatManager(int n)` Initializes a `SeatManager` object that will manage `n` seats numbered from `1` to `n`. All seats are initially available.
*   `int reserve()` Fetches the **smallest-numbered** unreserved seat, reserves it, and returns its number.

Design a class to find the `k<sup>th</sup>` largest element in a stream. Note that it is the `k<sup>th</sup>` largest element in the sorted order, not the `k<sup>th</sup>` distinct element.

Implement `KthLargest` class:

*   `KthLargest(int k, int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer `k` and the stream of integers `nums`.
*   `int add(int val)` Appends the integer `val` to the stream and returns the element representing the `k<sup>th</sup>` largest element in the stream.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add"]
[[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]]
Output
[null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8]

Explanation
KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(3, [4, 5, 8, 2]);
kthLargest.add(3);   // return 4
kthLargest.add(5);   // return 5
kthLargest.add(10);  // return 5
kthLargest.add(9);   // return 8
kthLargest.add(4);   // return 8
```

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `-10<sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `-10<sup>4</sup> <= val <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   At most `10<sup>4</sup>` calls will be made to `add`.
*   It is guaranteed that there will be at least `k` elements in the array when you search for the `k<sup>th</sup>` element.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

### [1882\. Process Tasks Using Servers :rainbow:](https://leetcode.com/problems/process-tasks-using-servers/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Heap (Priority Queue)](https://leetcode.com/tag/heap-priority-queue/)


You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `servers` and `tasks` of lengths `n`​​​​​​ and `m`​​​​​​ respectively. `servers[i]` is the **weight** of the `i<sup>​​​​​​th</sup>`​​​​ server, and `tasks[j]` is the **time needed** to process the `j<sup>​​​​​​th</sup>`​​​​ task **in seconds**.

Tasks are assigned to the servers using a **task queue**. Initially, all servers are free, and the queue is **empty**.

At second `j`, the `j<sup>th</sup>` task is **inserted** into the queue (starting with the `0<sup>th</sup>` task being inserted at second `0`). As long as there are free servers and the queue is not empty, the task in the front of the queue will be assigned to a free server with the **smallest weight**, and in case of a tie, it is assigned to a free server with the **smallest index**.

If there are no free servers and the queue is not empty, we wait until a server becomes free and immediately assign the next task. If multiple servers become free at the same time, then multiple tasks from the queue will be assigned **in order of insertion** following the weight and index priorities above.

A server that is assigned task `j` at second `t` will be free again at second `t + tasks[j]`.

Build an array `ans`​​​​ of length `m`, where `ans[j]` is the **index** of the server the `j<sup>​​​​​​th</sup>` task will be assigned to.

Return _the array_ `ans`​​​​.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: servers = [3,3,2], tasks = [1,2,3,2,1,2]
Output: [2,2,0,2,1,2]
Explanation: Events in chronological order go as follows:
- At second 0, task 0 is added and processed using server 2 until second 1.
- At second 1, server 2 becomes free. Task 1 is added and processed using server 2 until second 3.
- At second 2, task 2 is added and processed using server 0 until second 5.
- At second 3, server 2 becomes free. Task 3 is added and processed using server 2 until second 5.
- At second 4, task 4 is added and processed using server 1 until second 5.
- At second 5, all servers become free. Task 5 is added and processed using server 2 until second 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: servers = [5,1,4,3,2], tasks = [2,1,2,4,5,2,1]
Output: [1,4,1,4,1,3,2]
Explanation: Events in chronological order go as follows:
- At second 0, task 0 is added and processed using server 1 until second 2.
- At second 1, task 1 is added and processed using server 4 until second 2.
- At second 2, servers 1 and 4 become free. Task 2 is added and processed using server 1 until second 4\.
- At second 3, task 3 is added and processed using server 4 until second 7.
- At second 4, server 1 becomes free. Task 4 is added and processed using server 1 until second 9\.
- At second 5, task 5 is added and processed using server 3 until second 7.
- At second 6, task 6 is added and processed using server 2 until second 7.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `servers.length == n`

## Hash Table
### [953\. Verifying an Alien Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/verifying-an-alien-dictionary/)

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/)


In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different `order`. The `order` of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of `words` written in the alien language, and the `order` of the alphabet, return `true` if and only if the given `words` are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character ().
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= words.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
*   `order.length == 26`
*   All characters in `words[i]` and `order` are English lowercase letters.

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` _if_ `nums` _has a continuous subarray of size **at least two** whose elements sum up to a multiple of_ `k`_, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

An integer `x` is a multiple of `k` if there exists an integer `n` such that `x = n * k`. `0` is **always** a multiple of `k`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [23,2,4,6,7], k = 6
Output: true
Explanation: [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 whose elements sum up to 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [23,2,6,4,7], k = 6
Output: true
Explanation: [23, 2, 6, 4, 7] is an continuous subarray of size 5 whose elements sum up to 42.
42 is a multiple of 6 because 42 = 7 * 6 and 7 is an integer.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [23,2,6,4,7], k = 13
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>`
*   `0 <= sum(nums[i]) <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1`
*   `1 <= k <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1`


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```
Example:
nums = [23,2,4], k = 6
Lets walk through the code with the example.
(i=0) : sums = 23 => 23%6 => (sums = 5)
(i=1) : sums = 5+2=7 => 7%6 => (sums = 1)
(i=2) : sums = 1+4=5 => 5%6 => (sums = 5)
```

* We have encountered the same sums(remainder) again which means we have the subarray of `sums%k = 0`.
* But, there's another aspect to this problem. The subarray must have a minimum size of 2.

```
Counter example to understand this. Lets take nums = [23,6], k = 6
(i=0) : sums = 23 => 23%6 => (sums = 5)
(i=1) : sums = 5+6=11 => 11%6 => (sums = 5)

Implement the `RandomizedSet` class:

*   `RandomizedSet()` Initializes the `RandomizedSet` object.
*   `bool insert(int val)` Inserts an item `val` into the set if not present. Returns `true` if the item was not present, `false` otherwise.
*   `bool remove(int val)` Removes an item `val` from the set if present. Returns `true` if the item was present, `false` otherwise.
*   `int getRandom()` Returns a random element from the current set of elements (it's guaranteed that at least one element exists when this method is called). Each element must have the **same probability** of being returned.

You must implement the functions of the class such that each function works in **average** `O(1)` time complexity.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["RandomizedSet", "insert", "remove", "insert", "getRandom", "remove", "insert", "getRandom"]
[[], [1], [2], [2], [], [1], [2], []]
Output
[null, true, false, true, 2, true, false, 2]

Explanation
RandomizedSet randomizedSet = new RandomizedSet();
randomizedSet.insert(1); // Inserts 1 to the set. Returns true as 1 was inserted successfully.
randomizedSet.remove(2); // Returns false as 2 does not exist in the set.
randomizedSet.insert(2); // Inserts 2 to the set, returns true. Set now contains [1,2].
randomizedSet.getRandom(); // getRandom() should return either 1 or 2 randomly.
randomizedSet.remove(1); // Removes 1 from the set, returns true. Set now contains [2].
randomizedSet.insert(2); // 2 was already in the set, so return false.
randomizedSet.getRandom(); // Since 2 is the only number in the set, getRandom() will always return 2.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `-2<sup>31</sup> <= val <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1`
*   At most `2 * ``10<sup>5</sup>` calls will be made to `insert`, `remove`, and `getRandom`.
*   There will be **at least one** element in the data structure when `getRandom` is called.

`RandomizedCollection` is a data structure that contains a collection of numbers, possibly duplicates (i.e., a multiset). It should support inserting and removing specific elements and also removing a random element.

Implement the `RandomizedCollection` class:

*   `RandomizedCollection()` Initializes the empty `RandomizedCollection` object.
*   `bool insert(int val)` Inserts an item `val` into the multiset, even if the item is already present. Returns `true` if the item is not present, `false` otherwise.
*   `bool remove(int val)` Removes an item `val` from the multiset if present. Returns `true` if the item is present, `false` otherwise. Note that if `val` has multiple occurrences in the multiset, we only remove one of them.
*   `int getRandom()` Returns a random element from the current multiset of elements. The probability of each element being returned is **linearly related** to the number of same values the multiset contains.

You must implement the functions of the class such that each function works on **average** `O(1)` time complexity.

**Note:** The test cases are generated such that `getRandom` will only be called if there is **at least one** item in the `RandomizedCollection`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["RandomizedCollection", "insert", "insert", "insert", "getRandom", "remove", "getRandom"]

[null, true, false, true, 2, true, 1]

Explanation
RandomizedCollection randomizedCollection = new RandomizedCollection();
randomizedCollection.insert(1);   // return true since the collection does not contain 1.
                                  // Inserts 1 into the collection.

                                  // Inserts 2 into the collection. Collection now contains [1,1,2].
randomizedCollection.getRandom(); // getRandom should:
                                  // - return 1 with probability 2/3, or
                                  // - return 2 with probability 1/3.
randomizedCollection.remove(1);   // return true since the collection contains 1.
                                  // Removes 1 from the collection. Collection now contains [1,2].
randomizedCollection.getRandom(); // getRandom should return 1 or 2, both equally likely.

Related Topics: [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/)


Given two strings `s` and `t`, _determine if they are isomorphic_.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `t.length == s.length`
*   `s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.


#### Solution

```python
def isIsomorphic(s, t):
    def helper(s, t):
        lookup = {}
        for l_s, l_t in zip(s, t):
            if l_s in lookup:

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/)


Given a list `paths` of directory info, including the directory path, and all the files with contents in this directory, return _all the duplicate files in the file system in terms of their paths_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

A group of duplicate files consists of at least two files that have the same content.

A single directory info string in the input list has the following format:

*   `"root/d1/d2/.../dm f1.txt(f1_content) f2.txt(f2_content) ... fn.txt(fn_content)"`

It means there are `n` files `(f1.txt, f2.txt ... fn.txt)` with content `(f1_content, f2_content ... fn_content)` respectively in the directory "`root/d1/d2/.../dm"`. Note that `n >= 1` and `m >= 0`. If `m = 0`, it means the directory is just the root directory.

The output is a list of groups of duplicate file paths. For each group, it contains all the file paths of the files that have the same content. A file path is a string that has the following format:

*   `"directory_path/file_name.txt"`

**Example 1:**

```
Input: paths = ["root/a 1.txt(abcd) 2.txt(efgh)","root/c 3.txt(abcd)","root/c/d 4.txt(efgh)","root 4.txt(efgh)"]
Output: [["root/a/2.txt","root/c/d/4.txt","root/4.txt"],["root/a/1.txt","root/c/3.txt"]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: paths = ["root/a 1.txt(abcd) 2.txt(efgh)","root/c 3.txt(abcd)","root/c/d 4.txt(efgh)"]
Output: [["root/a/2.txt","root/c/d/4.txt"],["root/a/1.txt","root/c/3.txt"]]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= paths.length <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `1 <= paths[i].length <= 3000`
*   `1 <= sum(paths[i].length) <= 5 * 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `paths[i]` consist of English letters, digits, `'/'`, `'.'`, `'('`, `')'`, and `' '`.
*   You may assume no files or directories share the same name in the same directory.
*   You may assume each given directory info represents a unique directory. A single blank space separates the directory path and file info.

**Follow up:**

*   Imagine you are given a real file system, how will you search files? DFS or BFS?
*   If the file content is very large (GB level), how will you modify your solution?
*   If you can only read the file by 1kb each time, how will you modify your solution?
*   What is the time complexity of your modified solution? What is the most time-consuming part and memory-consuming part of it? How to optimize?
*   How to make sure the duplicated files you find are not false positive?

### [1807\. Evaluate the Bracket Pairs of a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-the-bracket-pairs-of-a-string/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/)


You are given a string `s` that contains some bracket pairs, with each pair containing a **non-empty** key.

*   For example, in the string `"(name)is(age)yearsold"`, there are **two** bracket pairs that contain the keys `"name"` and `"age"`.

You know the values of a wide range of keys. This is represented by a 2D string array `knowledge` where each `knowledge[i] = [key<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, value<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>]` indicates that key `key<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` has a value of `value<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>`.

You are tasked to evaluate **all** of the bracket pairs. When you evaluate a bracket pair that contains some key `key<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>`, you will:

*   Replace `key<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` and the bracket pair with the key's corresponding `value<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>`.
*   If you do not know the value of the key, you will replace `key<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` and the bracket pair with a question mark `"?"` (without the quotation marks).

Each key will appear at most once in your `knowledge`. There will not be any nested brackets in `s`.

Return _the resulting string after evaluating **all** of the bracket pairs._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "(name)is(age)yearsold", knowledge = [["name","bob"],["age","two"]]
Output: "bobistwoyearsold"
Explanation:
The key "name" has a value of "bob", so replace "(name)" with "bob".
The key "age" has a value of "two", so replace "(age)" with "two".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "hi(name)", knowledge = [["a","b"]]
Output: "hi?"
Explanation: As you do not know the value of the key "name", replace "(name)" with "?".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "(a)(a)(a)aaa", knowledge = [["a","yes"]]
Output: "yesyesyesaaa"
Explanation: The same key can appear multiple times.
The key "a" has a value of "yes", so replace all occurrences of "(a)" with "yes".
Notice that the "a"s not in a bracket pair are not evaluated.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `0 <= knowledge.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `knowledge[i].length == 2`
*   `1 <= key<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>.length, value<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>.length <= 10`
*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters and round brackets `'('` and `')'`.
*   Every open bracket `'('` in `s` will have a corresponding close bracket `')'`.
*   The key in each bracket pair of `s` will be non-empty.
*   There will not be any nested bracket pairs in `s`.
*   `key<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` and `value<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` consist of lowercase English letters.
*   Each `key<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` in `knowledge` is unique.

### [76\. Minimum Window Substring :rainbow:](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)

Difficulty: **Hard**  

Related Topics: [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Sliding Window](https://leetcode.com/tag/sliding-window/)


Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return _the **minimum window substring** of_ `s` _such that every character in_ `t` _(**including duplicates**) is included in the window. If there is no such substring__, return the empty string_ `""`_._

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `m == s.length`
*   `n == t.length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

    for i, chr in enumerate(s):
        if chr not in letter_needed:

There are several cards **arranged in a row**, and each card has an associated number of points. The points are given in the integer array `cardPoints`.

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly `k` cards.

Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.

Given the integer array `cardPoints` and the integer `k`, return the _maximum score_ you can obtain.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: After the first step, your score will always be 1\. However, choosing the rightmost card first will maximize your total score. The optimal strategy is to take the three cards on the right, giving a final score of 1 + 6 + 5 = 12.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Regardless of which two cards you take, your score will always be 4.
```

**Example 3:**

### [157\. Read N Characters Given Read4](https://leetcode.com/problems/read-n-characters-given-read4/)

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Simulation](https://leetcode.com/tag/simulation/), [Interactive](https://leetcode.com/tag/interactive/)


Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method to read `n` characters.

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

```
    Parameter:  char[] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4[] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4[].
```

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/157_example.png)

```
File file("abcde"); // File is "abcde", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4\. Now buf4 = "abcd", fp points to 'e'
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1\. Now buf4 = "e", fp points to end of file
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0\. Now buf4 = "", fp points to end of file
```

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

```
    Parameters:	char[] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf[] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf[].
```

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The `read` function will only be called once for each test case.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: file = "abc", n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "abc". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
Note that "abc" is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: file = "abcde", n = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "abcde". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: file = "abcdABCD1234", n = 12
Output: 12
Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "abcdABCD1234". We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: file = "leetcode", n = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "leetc". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= file.length <= 500`
*   `file` consist of English letters and digits.
*   `1 <= n <= 1000`

*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.
*   It is guaranteed that in a given test case the same buffer `buf` is called by `read`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: file = "abc", queries = [1,2,1]
Output: [1,2,0]
Explanation: The test case represents the following scenario:
File file("abc");
Solution sol;
sol.read(buf, 1); // After calling your read method, buf should contain "a". We read a total of 1 character from the file, so return 1.
sol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain "bc". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
Assume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: file = "abc", queries = [4,1]
Output: [3,0]
Explanation: The test case represents the following scenario:

Given two non-negative integers, `num1` and `num2` represented as string, return _the sum of_ `num1` _and_ `num2` _as a string_.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as `BigInteger`). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
Output: "134"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
Output: "533"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
Output: "0"
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `num1` and `num2` consist of only digits.
*   `num1` and `num2` don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**


```python
def addStrings(num1, num2):

    j = len(num2) - 1
    result = ''
    carry = 0
    while i >= 0 or j >= 0:

            i -= 1
        if j >= 0:
            carry += int(num2[j])
            j -= 1
        carry, curr = divmod(carry, 10)
        result = str(curr) + result
    if carry > 0:
        result = str(carry) + result

### [8\. String to Integer (atoi)](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/)


Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1.  Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
2.  Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
3.  Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
4.  Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `"123" -> 123`, `"0032" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
5.  If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup> - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-2<sup>31</sup>` should be clamped to `-2<sup>31</sup>`, and integers greater than `2<sup>31</sup> - 1` should be clamped to `2<sup>31</sup> - 1`.
6.  Return the integer as the final result.

**Note:**

*   Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.
*   **Do not ignore** any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "42"
Output: 42
Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "   -42"
Output: -42
Explanation:
Step 1: "   -42" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: "   -42" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: "   -42" ("42" is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "4193 with words"
Output: 4193
Explanation:
Step 1: "4193 with words" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "4193 with words" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "4193 with words" ("4193" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "words and 987"
Output: 0
Explanation:
Step 1: "words and 987" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "words and 987" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "words and 987" (reading stops immediately because there is a non-digit 'w')
         ^
The parsed integer is 0 because no digits were read.
Since 0 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 0.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: s = "-91283472332"
Output: -2147483648
Explanation:
Step 1: "-91283472332" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "-91283472332" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
          ^
Step 3: "-91283472332" ("91283472332" is read in)
                     ^
The parsed integer is -91283472332.
Since -91283472332 is less than the lower bound of the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is clamped to -231 = -2147483648\.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length <= 200`
*   `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`0-9`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.

Given a string `s` containing only three types of characters: `'('`, `')'` and `'*'`, return `true` _if_ `s` _is **valid**_.

The following rules define a **valid** string:

*   Any left parenthesis `'('` must have a corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.
*   Any right parenthesis `')'` must have a corresponding left parenthesis `'('`.
*   Left parenthesis `'('` must go before the corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.
*   `'*'` could be treated as a single right parenthesis `')'` or a single left parenthesis `'('` or an empty string `""`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "(*)"
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "(*))"
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
*   `s[i]` is `'('`, `')'` or `'*'`.

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Two Pointers](https://leetcode.com/tag/two-pointers/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/)


Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return _a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space._

**Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "  Bob    Loves  Alice   "
Output: "Alice Loves Bob"
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: s = "Alice does not even like bob"
Output: "bob like even not does Alice"
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
*   There is **at least one** word in `s`.

**Follow-up: **If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it **in-place** with `O(1)` extra space?


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
def reverseWords(s):
    words = s.split()
    words.reverse()
    return ' '.join(words)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reverseWords("the sky is blue")

### [38\. Count and Say](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/)


The **count-and-say** sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

*   `countAndSay(1) = "1"`
*   `countAndSay(n)` is the way you would "say" the digit string from `countAndSay(n-1)`, which is then converted into a different digit string.

To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the **minimal** number of groups so that each group is a contiguous section all of the **same character.** Then for each group, say the number of characters, then say the character. To convert the saying into a digit string, replace the counts with a number and concatenate every saying.

For example, the saying and conversion for digit string `"3322251"`:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/23/countandsay.jpg)

Given a positive integer `n`, return _the_ `n<sup>th</sup>` _term of the **count-and-say** sequence_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation:
countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 30`


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python

    n = len(s)
    result = ''
    for i in range(n):
        if s[j] != s[i]:

            j = i
        if i == n - 1:
            result += str(i - j + 1) + s[i]
    return result

### [68\. Text Justification :rainbow:](https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/)

Difficulty: **Hard**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Simulation](https://leetcode.com/tag/simulation/)


Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

*   A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
*   Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
*   The input array `words` contains at least one word.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
  "What   must   be",
  "acknowledgment  ",
  "shall be        "
]
Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain","to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"], maxWidth = 20
Output:
[
  "Science  is  what we",
  "understand      well",
  "enough to explain to",
  "a  computer.  Art is",
  "everything  else  we",
  "do                  "
]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= words.length <= 300`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
*   `words[i]` consists of only English letters and symbols.
*   `1 <= maxWidth <= 100`
*   `words[i].length <= maxWidth`


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
def fullJustify(words, maxWidth):
    result = []
    cur = []
    count_letters = 0
    for word in words:
        if count_letters + len(cur) + len(word) > maxWidth:
            for i in range(maxWidth - count_letters):
                number_space = len(cur) - 1
                cur[i % (number_space or 1)] += ' '
            result.append(''.join(cur))
            cur = []
            count_letters = 0
        cur.append(word)
        count_letters += len(word)
    return result + [' '.join(cur).ljust(maxWidth)]

### [1541\. Minimum Insertions to Balance a Parentheses String](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-insertions-to-balance-a-parentheses-string/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Stack](https://leetcode.com/tag/stack/), [Greedy](https://leetcode.com/tag/greedy/)


Given a parentheses string `s` containing only the characters `'('` and `')'`. A parentheses string is **balanced** if:

*   Any left parenthesis `'('` must have a corresponding two consecutive right parenthesis `'))'`.
*   Left parenthesis `'('` must go before the corresponding two consecutive right parenthesis `'))'`.

In other words, we treat `'('` as openning parenthesis and `'))'` as closing parenthesis.

For example, `"())"`, `"())(())))"` and `"(())())))"` are balanced, `")()"`, `"()))"` and `"(()))"` are not balanced.

You can insert the characters `'('` and `')'` at any position of the string to balance it if needed.

Return _the minimum number of insertions_ needed to make `s` balanced.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "(()))"
Output: 1
Explanation: The second '(' has two matching '))', but the first '(' has only ')' matching. We need to to add one more ')' at the end of the string to be "(())))" which is balanced.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "())"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string is already balanced.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "))())("
Output: 3
Explanation: Add '(' to match the first '))', Add '))' to match the last '('.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "(((((("
Output: 12
Explanation: Add 12 ')' to balance the string.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: s = ")))))))"
Output: 5
Explanation: Add 4 '(' at the beginning of the string and one ')' at the end. The string becomes "(((())))))))".
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
*   `s` consists of `'('` and `')'` only.

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Sorting](https://leetcode.com/tag/sorting/)


You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` that you must perform `k` replacement operations on. The replacement operations are given as three **0-indexed** parallel arrays, `indices`, `sources`, and `targets`, all of length `k`.

To complete the `i<sup>th</sup>` replacement operation:

1.  Check if the **substring** `sources[i]` occurs at index `indices[i]` in the **original string** `s`.
2.  If it does not occur, **do nothing**.
3.  Otherwise if it does occur, **replace** that substring with `targets[i]`.

For example, if `s = "<u style="display: inline;">ab</u>cd"`, `indices[i] = 0`, `sources[i] = "ab"`, and `targets[i] = "eee"`, then the result of this replacement will be `"<u style="display: inline;">eee</u>cd"`.

All replacement operations must occur **simultaneously**, meaning the replacement operations should not affect the indexing of each other. The testcases will be generated such that the replacements will **not overlap**.

*   For example, a testcase with `s = "abc"`, `indices = [0, 1]`, and `sources = ["ab","bc"]` will not be generated because the `"ab"` and `"bc"` replacements overlap.

Return _the **resulting string** after performing all replacement operations on_ `s`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/12/833-ex1.png)

```
Input: s = "abcd", indices = [0, 2], sources = ["a", "cd"], targets = ["eee", "ffff"]
Output: "eeebffff"
Explanation:
"a" occurs at index 0 in s, so we replace it with "eee".
"cd" occurs at index 2 in s, so we replace it with "ffff".
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/12/833-ex2-1.png)

```
Input: s = "abcd", indices = [0, 2], sources = ["ab","ec"], targets = ["eee","ffff"]
Output: "eeecd"
Explanation:
"ab" occurs at index 0 in s, so we replace it with "eee".
"ec" does not occur at index 2 in s, so we do nothing.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
*   `k == indices.length == sources.length == targets.length`
*   `1 <= k <= 100`
*   `0 <= indexes[i] < s.length`
*   `1 <= sources[i].length, targets[i].length <= 50`
*   `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
*   `sources[i]` and `targets[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
def findReplaceString(s, indices, sources, targets):
    d = {indices: (sources, target) for indices, sources, target in zip(indices, sources, targets)}
    result = ''
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if i in d and s[i: i + len(d[i][0])] == d[i][0]:
            result += d[i][1]
            i += len(d[i][0])
        else:
            result += s[i]
            i += 1
    return result

  // ... your code
  return encoded_string;
}</string>
```

Machine 2 (receiver) has the function:

```
vector <string>decode(string s) {
  //... your code
  return strs;
}</string>
```

So Machine 1 does:

```
string encoded_string = encode(strs);
```

and Machine 2 does:

```
vector <string>strs2 = decode(encoded_string);</string>
```

`strs2` in Machine 2 should be the same as `strs` in Machine 1.

Implement the `encode` and `decode` methods.

You are not allowed to solve the problem using any serialize methods (such as `eval`).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: dummy_input = ["Hello","World"]
Output: ["Hello","World"]
Explanation:
Machine 1:
Codec encoder = new Codec();
String msg = encoder.encode(strs);
Machine 1 ---msg---> Machine 2

Machine 2:
Codec decoder = new Codec();
String[] strs = decoder.decode(msg);
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: dummy_input = [""]
Output: [""]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
*   `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
*   `strs[i]` contains any possible characters out of `256` valid ASCII characters.

**Follow up:** Could you write a generalized algorithm to work on any possible set of characters?


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
class Codec:
    def encode(self, strs):
        return ''.join('%d:' % len(s) + s for s in strs)

    def decode(self, s):
        strs = []
        i = 0
        while i < len(s):
            j = s.find(':', i)
            i = j + 1 + int(s[i:j])
            strs.append(s[j+1:i])
        return strs

codec = Codec()
s = codec.encode(["Hello","World"])
codec.decode(s)
```

### [811\. Subdomain Visit Count](https://leetcode.com/problems/subdomain-visit-count/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/)


A website domain `"discuss.leetcode.com"` consists of various subdomains. At the top level, we have `"com"`, at the next level, we have `"leetcode.com"` and at the lowest level, `"discuss.leetcode.com"`. When we visit a domain like `"discuss.leetcode.com"`, we will also visit the parent domains `"leetcode.com"` and `"com"` implicitly.

A **count-paired domain** is a domain that has one of the two formats `"rep d1.d2.d3"` or `"rep d1.d2"` where `rep` is the number of visits to the domain and `d1.d2.d3` is the domain itself.

*   For example, `"9001 discuss.leetcode.com"` is a **count-paired domain** that indicates that `discuss.leetcode.com` was visited `9001` times.

Given an array of **count-paired domains** `cpdomains`, return _an array of the **count-paired domains** of each subdomain in the input_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: cpdomains = ["9001 discuss.leetcode.com"]
Output: ["9001 leetcode.com","9001 discuss.leetcode.com","9001 com"]
Explanation: We only have one website domain: "discuss.leetcode.com".
As discussed above, the subdomain "leetcode.com" and "com" will also be visited. So they will all be visited 9001 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: cpdomains = ["900 google.mail.com", "50 yahoo.com", "1 intel.mail.com", "5 wiki.org"]
Output: ["901 mail.com","50 yahoo.com","900 google.mail.com","5 wiki.org","5 org","1 intel.mail.com","951 com"]
Explanation: We will visit "google.mail.com" 900 times, "yahoo.com" 50 times, "intel.mail.com" once and "wiki.org" 5 times.
For the subdomains, we will visit "mail.com" 900 + 1 = 901 times, "com" 900 + 50 + 1 = 951 times, and "org" 5 times.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= cpdomain.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= cpdomain[i].length <= 100`
*   `cpdomain[i]` follows either the `"rep<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub> d1<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>.d2<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>.d3<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>"` format or the `"rep<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub> d1<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>.d2<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>"` format.
*   `rep<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` is an integer in the range `[1, 10<sup>4</sup>]`.
*   `d1<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>`, `d2<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>`, and `d3<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` consist of lowercase English letters.

You are given several logs, where each log contains a unique ID and timestamp. Timestamp is a string that has the following format: `Year:Month:Day:Hour:Minute:Second`, for example, `2017:01:01:23:59:59`. All domains are zero-padded decimal numbers.

Implement the `LogSystem` class:

*   `LogSystem()` Initializes the `LogSystem`object.
*   `void put(int id, string timestamp)` Stores the given log `(id, timestamp)` in your storage system.
*   `int[] retrieve(string start, string end, string granularity)` Returns the IDs of the logs whose timestamps are within the range from `start` to `end` inclusive. `start` and `end` all have the same format as `timestamp`, and `granularity` means how precise the range should be (i.e. to the exact `Day`, `Minute`, etc.). For example, `start = "2017:01:01:23:59:59"`, `end = "2017:01:02:23:59:59"`, and `granularity = "Day"` means that we need to find the logs within the inclusive range from **Jan. 1st 2017** to **Jan. 2nd 2017**, and the `Hour`, `Minute`, and `Second` for each log entry can be ignored.

**Example 1:**

```

logSystem.retrieve("2016:01:01:01:01:01", "2017:01:01:23:00:00", "Year");

// return [2,1], because you need to return all logs between Jan. 1, 2016 01:XX:XX and Jan. 1, 2017 23:XX:XX.
// Log 3 is not returned because Jan. 1, 2016 00:00:00 comes before the start of the range.
logSystem.retrieve("2016:01:01:01:01:01", "2017:01:01:23:00:00", "Hour");

Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a .

Implement the `LRUCache` class:

*   `LRUCache(int capacity)` Initialize the LRU cache with **positive** size `capacity`.
*   `int get(int key)` Return the value of the `key` if the key exists, otherwise return `-1`.
*   `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if the `key` exists. Otherwise, add the `key-value` pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the `capacity` from this operation, **evict** the least recently used key.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in `O(1)` average time complexity.

### [138\. Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/), [Linked List](https://leetcode.com/tag/linked-list/)


A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` **brand new** nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list**.

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return _the head of the copied linked list_.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

*   `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
*   `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

Your code will **only** be given the `head` of the original linked list.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/e1.png)

```
Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/e2.png)

```
Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]
```

**Example 3:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/e3.png)**

```
Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= n <= 1000`
*   `-10<sup>4</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `Node.random` is `null` or is pointing to some node in the linked list.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

*   The "linked list" should use the same `TreeNode` class where the `right` child pointer points to the next node in the list and the `left` child pointer is always `null`.
*   The "linked list" should be in the same order as a of the binary tree.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/14/flaten.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Follow up:** Can you flatten the tree in-place (with `O(1)` extra space)?

### [160\. Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/), [Linked List](https://leetcode.com/tag/linked-list/), [Two Pointers](https://leetcode.com/tag/two-pointers/)


Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_statement.png)

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.
*   `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_1_1.png)

```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_2.png)

```
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_3.png)

```
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
*   The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
*   `0 <= m, n <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `0 <= skipA <= m`
*   `0 <= skipB <= n`
*   `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that runs in `O(n)` time and use only `O(1)` memory?

#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):

Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.

Implement the `MyHashMap` class:

*   `MyHashMap()` initializes the object with an empty map.
*   `void put(int key, int value)` inserts a `(key, value)` pair into the HashMap. If the `key` already exists in the map, update the corresponding `value`.
*   `int get(int key)` returns the `value` to which the specified `key` is mapped, or `-1` if this map contains no mapping for the `key`.
*   `void remove(key)` removes the `key` and its corresponding `value` if the map contains the mapping for the `key`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["MyHashMap", "put", "put", "get", "get", "put", "get", "remove", "get"]
[[], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3], [2, 1], [2], [2], [2]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, -1, null, 1, null, -1]

Explanation
MyHashMap myHashMap = new MyHashMap();
myHashMap.put(1, 1); // The map is now [[1,1]]
myHashMap.put(2, 2); // The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.get(1);    // return 1, The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.get(3);    // return -1 (i.e., not found), The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.put(2, 1); // The map is now [[1,1], [2,1]] (i.e., update the existing value)
myHashMap.get(2);    // return 1, The map is now [[1,1], [2,1]]
myHashMap.remove(2); // remove the mapping for 2, The map is now [[1,1]]
myHashMap.get(2);    // return -1 (i.e., not found), The map is now [[1,1]]

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Linked List](https://leetcode.com/tag/linked-list/)


Write a function to **delete a node** in a singly-linked list. You will **not** be given access to the `head` of the list, instead you will be given access to **the node to be deleted** directly.

It is **guaranteed** that the node to be deleted is **not a tail node** in the list.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/node1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4], node = 3
Output: [1,2,4]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: head = [0,1], node = 0

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
*   The value of each node in the list is **unique**.
*   The `node` to be deleted is **in the list** and is **not a tail** node


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

拿到这个题时以为要从头找到这个节点前一个节点，然后删除当前节点。这个应该是正常思路。

但是，题目只给出了删除的这个节点，没有给出根节点。所以可以通过这个将当前的节点的数值改成下面的节点的值，然后删除下一个节点的方式。

链表基本操作，记待删除节点为node：

令`node.val = node.next.val，node.next = node.next.next`即可

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10<sup>4</sup>]`.
*   `-10<sup>5</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

```
Input: l1 = [7,2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,8,0,7]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [8,0,7]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 9`

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as . You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path_.

**Example 1:**

Implement the `BSTIterator` class that represents an iterator over the of a binary search tree (BST):

*   `BSTIterator(TreeNode root)` Initializes an object of the `BSTIterator` class. The `root` of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.
*   `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns `false`.
*   `int next()` Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer.

Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to `next()` will return the smallest element in the BST.

You may assume that `next()` calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next number in the in-order traversal when `next()` is called.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/25/bst-tree.png)

```
Input
["BSTIterator", "next", "next", "hasNext", "next", "hasNext", "next", "hasNext", "next", "hasNext"]
[[[7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20]], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, 3, 7, true, 9, true, 15, true, 20, false]

Explanation
BSTIterator bSTIterator = new BSTIterator([7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20]);
bSTIterator.next();    // return 3
bSTIterator.next();    // return 7
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True
bSTIterator.next();    // return 9
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True
bSTIterator.next();    // return 15
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True
bSTIterator.next();    // return 20
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return False
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10<sup>5</sup>]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 10<sup>6</sup>`
*   At most `10<sup>5</sup>` calls will be made to `hasNext`, and `next`.

**Follow up:**

*   Could you implement `next()` and `hasNext()` to run in average `O(1)` time and use `O(h)` memory, where `h` is the height of the tree?

#### Solution

Language: **Python**

The idea is fairly simple (and the same as finding the convergence point of 2 linked lists). We keep two pointers, `p1` and `p2`. Originally, these pointers point to `q` and `p`, respectively. Then we follow their parent pointers until they point to the same node. When either of the pointers points to `root`, we set it to the other original starting node. For example, when `p1` points to root (i.e `p1.parent is None`), assign `q` to `p1`.

Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a **binary search tree**. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**The encoded string should be as compact as possible.**

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,1,3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10<sup>4</sup>]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   The input tree is **guaranteed** to be a binary search tree.


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

看到BST，就一定想到了一个性质： BST的中序遍历是有序的。但我们又知道，只知道树的一种遍历方式，是没法确定这个树的，BST也不例外。

因此，这个题采用前序遍历的方式，这样，遍历得到的第一个数组就是BST的根节点，数组后面的这些数中比根节点的值小的是根节点的左子树，比根节点值大的是根节点的右子树（BST的最重要性质）。

因此，重要结论：BST的前序遍历能唯一的确定一颗BST

解编码过程是通过一个队列进行操作。其实也可以是list，不过队列的效率更高。
```python
class Codec:
    def serialize(self, root):
        vals = []

        def preOrder(node):
            if node:
                vals.append(node.val)
                preOrder(node.left)
                preOrder(node.right)

        preOrder(root)

        return ' '.join(map(str, vals))

    # O( N ) since each val run build once

#### Solution

Language: **Python**

解决本题需要牢牢掌握先序遍历和中序遍历的含义，以及递归。

先序遍历：根节点，左子树的先序遍历，右子树的先序遍历。
中序遍历：左子树的中序遍历，根节点，右子树的中序遍历。

可以看出，先序遍历的开头第一个元素是根元素。找到根节点在中序遍历中的位置，则可以利用根节点将中序遍历的数组分割出左右子树。再根据左右子树的长度对先序遍历的数组切片。使用递归则可以构建出完整的树。

很多朋友不理解递归，这里多说一下怎么理解递归。首先一定要明确递归函数的定义、其输入和输出是什么，而不用明白该函数内部具体是怎么实现的。我们将递归函数当做黑盒使用，也当做普通函数使用，一定不要试图用大脑理解该递归函数内部是怎么递归的，很容易绕进去。即，我不需要知道这个函数怎么实现的，我调用这个函数就是能实现某个功能。

比如对于本题而言，`buildTree(preorder, inorder`)函数的输入是一棵树的先序遍历序列和中序遍历序列，该函数的返回值是构建好的这棵树的根节点。我们在找到`root`节点后，设定其左右子树时，依然调用`buildTree(preorder, inorder)`，此时的输入变成了`root`左右子树对应的先序遍历和中序遍历序列，该函数的返回值就是构建好的左右子树的根节点。

至此代码就写完了，我们看到构建 `root` 的左右子树时，直接使用`buildTree(preorder, inorder)`函数，只要给定正确的输入，这个函数就能给正确的输出，不用去向这个函数到底干了什么。

Related Topics: [Tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/tree/), [Depth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/depth-first-search/), [Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-tree/)


Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly `two` or `zero` sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes. More formally, the property `root.val = min(root.left.val, root.right.val)` always holds.

Given such a binary tree, you need to output the **second minimum** value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.

If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/15/smbt1.jpg)

Input: root = [2,2,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest value.
```

**Constraints:**

思路: 题意是说每个结点的右子树要么为空, 要么一定有一个左子树孩子和一个右子树孩子, 因此树的形状是左偏的. 所以我们要将最左边的子树作为最终的新根结点, 然后递归的将其父结点作为其右孩子,并且父结点的右孩子作为其左孩子. 一个非常重要的地方是每次一定要将父结点的左右孩子都置为空, 因为父结点设置成其左孩子的右孩子之后成了叶子结点, 需要将其指针断掉.

For a binary tree **T**, we can define a **flip operation** as follows: choose any node, and swap the left and right child subtrees.

A binary tree **X** is _flip equivalent_ to a binary tree **Y** if and only if we can make **X** equal to **Y** after some number of flip operations.

Given the roots of two binary trees `root1` and `root2`, return `true` if the two trees are flip equivalent or `false` otherwise.

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/tree/), [Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-search-tree/), [Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-tree/)


Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

1.  Search for a node to remove.
2.  If the node is found, delete the node.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/04/del_node_1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3\. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [], key = 0
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10<sup>4</sup>]`.
*   `-10<sup>5</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   Each node has a **unique** value.
*   `root` is a valid binary search tree.
*   `-10<sup>5</sup> <= key <= 10<sup>5</sup>`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it with time complexity `O(height of tree)`?


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

```python
def deleteNode(root, key):
    if not root: # if root doesn't exist, just return it
        return root
    if root.val > key: # if key value is less than root value, find the node in the left subtree
        root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key)
    elif root.val < key: # if key value is greater than root value, find the node in right subtree
        root.right  = deleteNode(root.right, key)
    else: #if we found the node (root.value == key), start to delete it
        if not root.right: # if it doesn't have right children, we delete the node then new root would be root.left
            return root.left
        if not root.left: # if it has no left children, we delete the node then new root would be root.right
            return root.right
            # if the node have both left and right children,  we replace its value with the minmimum value in the right subtree and then delete that minimum node in the right subtree
        temp = root.right
        mini = temp.val
        while temp.left:
            temp = temp.left
            mini = temp.val
        root.val = mini # replace value
        root.right = deleteNode(root.right, root.val) # delete the minimum node in right subtree
    return root

本题的做法，就是求本节点+孙子更深节点vs儿子节点+重孙更深的节点的比较。

道理能想明白，代码有点难写。用了dfs函数，虽然递归是自顶向下的，但是因为是不断的return，所以真正求值是从底向上的。用到了一个有两个元素的列表，分别保存了之前层的，不取节点和取节点的情况。然后遍历左右子树，求出当前节点取和不取能得到的值，再返回给上一层。注意这个里面的robcurr是当前节点能达到的最大值，所以最后返回结果的时候试试返回的root节点robcurr的值。

#### Solution

Language: **Python**


由于后序遍历把根节点放到了最后，而我们在遍历的过程中，一定先获得到根节点，那么我们可以先倒序，然后再反转。

* 后序遍历：`左->右->根。`
* 我们的做法：`根->右->左`，然后再反转。

即，先把根节点放入栈中，然后把它左孩子、右孩子依次放入，这样我们下次对栈内的元素遍历得到的顺序就是从右向左的，对于栈中弹出的每个节点都是如此。

得到的顺序是`根->右子树(节点全部入栈)->左子树`的遍历方式，最后需要加一个翻转即可得到想要的后序遍历。

```python
# sol1: recursive
def postorderTraversal(root):
        if root == None:

Given the `root` of a binary search tree, return _a **balanced** binary search tree with the same node values_. If there is more than one answer, return **any of them**.

A binary search tree is **balanced** if the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than `1`.

**Example 1:**

* [解题大意](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/balance-a-binary-search-tree/solution/ti-jie-leetcode-1382-jiang-er-cha-sou-suo-shu-bian/)

解题思路:
解题关键在：所给的二叉树为一个 二叉搜索树。

二叉搜索树 意味着： 其中序遍历是一个单调递增的序列。

这和题目所求的变平衡有何关系呢？

变平衡从某种程度上意味着，根节点是左右孩子的中位数。（个人理解）

那么可以确定的一种思路为：

1.  中序遍历原二叉搜索树，将遍历结果保存到 ans 向量中
2. 在 ans 中，每次选取其中位数作为根节点，中位数左半部分的中位数作为其左孩子，中位数右半部分的中位数作为其右孩子
3. 步骤2中的选取和操作，使用递归来实现

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/tree/), [Depth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/depth-first-search/), [Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-search-tree/), [Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-tree/)


Given the `root` of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as `low` and `high`, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in `[low, high]`. Trimming the tree should **not** change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a **unique answer**.

Return _the root of the trimmed binary search tree_. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/09/trim1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,0,2], low = 1, high = 2
Output: [1,null,2]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/09/trim2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,0,4,null,2,null,null,1], low = 1, high = 3
Output: [3,2,null,1]
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree in the range `[1, 10<sup>4</sup>]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   The value of each node in the tree is **unique**.
*   `root` is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
*   `0 <= low <= high <= 10<sup>4</sup>`

Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string.

Implement the `WordDictionary` class:

*   `WordDictionary()` Initializes the object.
*   `void addWord(word)` Adds `word` to the data structure, it can be matched later.
*   `bool search(word)` Returns `true` if there is any string in the data structure that matches `word` or `false` otherwise. `word` may contain dots `'.'` where dots can be matched with any letter.

**Example:**

```
Input
["WordDictionary","addWord","addWord","addWord","search","search","search","search"]
[[],["bad"],["dad"],["mad"],["pad"],["bad"],[".ad"],["b.."]]
Output
[null,null,null,null,false,true,true,true]

Explanation
WordDictionary wordDictionary = new WordDictionary();
wordDictionary.addWord("bad");
wordDictionary.addWord("dad");
wordDictionary.addWord("mad");
wordDictionary.search("pad"); // return False
wordDictionary.search("bad"); // return True
wordDictionary.search(".ad"); // return True
wordDictionary.search("b.."); // return True
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= word.length <= 500`
*   `word` in `addWord` consists lower-case English letters.
*   `word` in `search` consist of  `'.'` or lower-case English letters.
*   At most `50000` calls will be made to `addWord` and `search`.

A (pronounced as "try") or **prefix tree** is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the Trie class:

*   `Trie()` Initializes the trie object.
*   `void insert(String word)` Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
*   `boolean search(String word)` Returns `true` if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `false` otherwise.
*   `boolean startsWith(String prefix)` Returns `true` if there is a previously inserted string `word` that has the prefix `prefix`, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["Trie", "insert", "search", "search", "startsWith", "insert", "search"]
[[], ["apple"], ["apple"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"]]
Output
[null, null, true, false, true, null, true]

Explanation
Trie trie = new Trie();
trie.insert("apple");
trie.search("apple");   // return True
trie.search("app");     // return False
trie.startsWith("app"); // return True
trie.insert("app");
trie.search("app");     // return True
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= word.length, prefix.length <= 2000`
*   `word` and `prefix` consist only of lowercase English letters.
*   At most `3 * 10<sup>4</sup>` calls **in total** will be made to `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith`.

"dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog";
"ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["cat","dog","catdog"]
Output: ["catdog"]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= words.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `0 <= words[i].length <= 1000`
*   `words[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Trie](https://leetcode.com/tag/trie/)


Given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord`. We want to design a system that suggests at most three product names from `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with the searchWord. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.

Return _list of lists_ of the suggested `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
Output: [
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"]
]
Explanation: products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"]
After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"]
After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
Output: [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: products = ["bags","baggage","banner","box","cloths"], searchWord = "bags"
Output: [["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags"],["bags"]]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "tatiana"
Output: [[],[],[],[],[],[],[]]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= products.length <= 1000`
*   There are no repeated elements in `products`.
*   `1 <= Σ products[i].length <= 2 * 10^4`
*   All characters of `products[i]` are lower-case English letters.
*   `1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000`
*   All characters of `searchWord` are lower-case English letters.

### [642\. Design Search Autocomplete System :fire:](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-search-autocomplete-system/)

Difficulty: **Hard**  

Related Topics: [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Design](https://leetcode.com/tag/design/), [Trie](https://leetcode.com/tag/trie/), [Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/tag/data-stream/)


Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. Users may input a sentence (at least one word and end with a special character `'#'`).

You are given a string array `sentences` and an integer array `times` both of length `n` where `sentences[i]` is a previously typed sentence and `times[i]` is the corresponding number of times the sentence was typed. For each input character except `'#'`, return the top `3` historical hot sentences that have the same prefix as the part of the sentence already typed.

Here are the specific rules:

*   The hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly same sentence before.
*   The returned top `3` hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is the hottest one). If several sentences have the same hot degree, use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).
*   If less than `3` hot sentences exist, return as many as you can.
*   When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you need to return an empty list.

Implement the `AutocompleteSystem` class:

*   `AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times)` Initializes the object with the `sentences` and `times` arrays.
*   `List<String> input(char c)` This indicates that the user typed the character `c`.
    *   Returns an empty array `[]` if `c == '#'` and stores the inputted sentence in the system.
    *   Returns the top `3` historical hot sentences that have the same prefix as the part of the sentence already typed. If there are fewer than `3` matches, return them all.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["AutocompleteSystem", "input", "input", "input", "input"]
[[["i love you", "island", "iroman", "i love leetcode"], [5, 3, 2, 2]], ["i"], [" "], ["a"], ["#"]]
Output
[null, ["i love you", "island", "i love leetcode"], ["i love you", "i love leetcode"], [], []]

Explanation
AutocompleteSystem obj = new AutocompleteSystem(["i love you", "island", "iroman", "i love leetcode"], [5, 3, 2, 2]);
obj.input("i"); // return ["i love you", "island", "i love leetcode"]. There are four sentences that have prefix "i". Among them, "ironman" and "i love leetcode" have same hot degree. Since ' ' has ASCII code 32 and 'r' has ASCII code 114, "i love leetcode" should be in front of "ironman". Also we only need to output top 3 hot sentences, so "ironman" will be ignored.
obj.input(" "); // return ["i love you", "i love leetcode"]. There are only two sentences that have prefix "i ".
obj.input("a"); // return []. There are no sentences that have prefix "i a".
obj.input("#"); // return []. The user finished the input, the sentence "i a" should be saved as a historical sentence in system. And the following input will be counted as a new search.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == sentences.length`
*   `n == times.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 100`
*   `1 <= sentences[i].length <= 100`
*   `1 <= times[i] <= 50`
*   `c` is a lowercase English letter, a hash `'#'`, or space `' '`.
*   Each tested sentence will be a sequence of characters `c` that end with the character `'#'`.
*   Each tested sentence will have a length in the range `[1, 200]`.
*   The words in each input sentence are separated by single spaces.
*   At most `5000` calls will be made to `input`.

You are given an array of variable pairs `equations` and an array of real numbers `values`, where `equations[i] = [A<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, B<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>]` and `values[i]` represent the equation `A<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub> / B<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub> = values[i]`. Each `A<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` or `B<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some `queries`, where `queries[j] = [C<sub style="display: inline;">j</sub>, D<sub style="display: inline;">j</sub>]` represents the `j<sup>th</sup>` query where you must find the answer for `C<sub style="display: inline;">j</sub> / D<sub style="display: inline;">j</sub> = ?`.

Return _the answers to all queries_. If a single answer cannot be determined, return `-1.0`.

**Note:** The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]
Explanation:
Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ?
return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
```

**Example 2:**

Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]

#### Solution

Language: **Python**

* Let N be the number of input equations and M be the number of queries. For each query, we need to traverse the graph. In the worst case, we might need to traverse the entire graph, which could take O(N). Hence, in total, the evaluation of queries could take M⋅O(N)=O(M⋅N).
* Space: O(N)

```python
def calcEquation(equations, values, queries):
    def dfs(graph, start, end, visited):
        if start == end and graph[start]:
            return 1.0

        visited.add(start)
        for neigh, val in graph[start]:
            if neigh in visited:
                continue

            tmp = dfs(graph, neigh, end, visited)
            if tmp > 0:
                return val * tmp

        return -1.0

    graph = collections.defaultdict(set)
    for items, v in zip(equations, values):
        x, y = items
        graph[x].add((y, v))
        graph[y].add((x, 1.0 / v))

    res = []
    for q in queries:
        res.append(dfs(graph, q[0], q[1], set()))

    return res


equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]]; values = [2.0,3.0]; queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]

### [1514\. Path with Maximum Probability :rainbow:](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-probability/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Graph](https://leetcode.com/tag/graph/), [Heap (Priority Queue)](https://leetcode.com/tag/heap-priority-queue/), [Shortest Path](https://leetcode.com/tag/shortest-path/)


You are given an undirected weighted graph of `n` nodes (0-indexed), represented by an edge list where `edges[i] = [a, b]` is an undirected edge connecting the nodes `a` and `b` with a probability of success of traversing that edge `succProb[i]`.

Given two nodes `start` and `end`, find the path with the maximum probability of success to go from `start` to `end` and return its success probability.

If there is no path from `start` to `end`, **return 0**. Your answer will be accepted if it differs from the correct answer by at most **1e-5**.

**Example 1:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/20/1558_ex1.png)**

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.2], start = 0, end = 2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: There are two paths from start to end, one having a probability of success = 0.2 and the other has 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.
```

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/20/1558_ex2.png)**

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.3], start = 0, end = 2
Output: 0.30000
```

**Example 3:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/20/1558_ex3.png)**

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1]], succProb = [0.5], start = 0, end = 2
Output: 0.00000
Explanation: There is no path between 0 and 2.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= start, end < n`
*   `start != end`
*   `0 <= a, b < n`
*   `a != b`

Difficulty: **Hard**  

Related Topics: [Graph](https://leetcode.com/tag/graph/), [Design](https://leetcode.com/tag/design/), [Topological Sort](https://leetcode.com/tag/topological-sort/)


Design the basic function of **Excel** and implement the function of the sum formula.

Implement the `Excel` class:

*   `Excel(int height, char width)` Initializes the object with the `height` and the `width` of the sheet. The sheet is an integer matrix `mat` of size `height x width` with the row index in the range `[1, height]` and the column index in the range `['A', width]`. All the values should be **zero** initially.
*   `void set(int row, char column, int val)` Changes the value at `mat[row][column]` to be `val`.
*   `int get(int row, char column)` Returns the value at `mat[row][column]`.
*   `int sum(int row, char column, List<String> numbers)` Sets the value at `mat[row][column]` to be the sum of cells represented by `numbers` and returns the value at `mat[row][column]`. This sum formula **should exist** until this cell is overlapped by another value or another sum formula. `numbers[i]` could be on the format:
    *   `"ColRow"` that represents a single cell.
        *   For example, `"F7"` represents the cell `mat[7]['F']`.
    *   `"ColRow1:ColRow2"` that represents a range of cells. The range will always be a rectangle where `"ColRow1"` represent the position of the top-left cell, and `"ColRow2"` represents the position of the bottom-right cell.
        *   For example, `"B3:F7"` represents the cells `mat[i][j]` for `3 <= i <= 7` and `'B' <= j <= 'F'`.

**Note:** You could assume that there will not be any circular sum reference.

*   For example, `mat[1]['A'] == sum(1, "B")` and `mat[1]['B'] == sum(1, "A")`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["Excel", "set", "sum", "set", "get"]
[[3, "C"], [1, "A", 2], [3, "C", ["A1", "A1:B2"]], [2, "B", 2], [3, "C"]]
Output
[null, null, 4, null, 6]

Explanation
Excel excel = new Excel(3, "C");
 // construct a 3*3 2D array with all zero.
 //   A B C
 // 1 0 0 0
 // 2 0 0 0
 // 3 0 0 0
excel.set(1, "A", 2);
 // set mat[1]["A"] to be 2.
 //   A B C
 // 1 2 0 0
 // 2 0 0 0
 // 3 0 0 0
excel.sum(3, "C", ["A1", "A1:B2"]); // return 4
 // set mat[3]["C"] to be the sum of value at mat[1]["A"] and the values sum of the rectangle range whose top-left cell is mat[1]["A"] and bottom-right cell is mat[2]["B"].
 //   A B C
 // 1 2 0 0
 // 2 0 0 0
 // 3 0 0 4
excel.set(2, "B", 2);
 // set mat[2]["B"] to be 2\. Note mat[3]["C"] should also be changed.
 //   A B C
 // 1 2 0 0
 // 2 0 2 0
 // 3 0 0 6
excel.get(3, "C"); // return 6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= height <= 26`
*   `'A' <= width <= 'Z'`
*   `1 <= row <= height`
*   `'A' <= column <= width`
*   `-100 <= val <= 100`
*   `1 <= numbers.length <= 5`
*   `numbers[i]` has the format `"ColRow"` or `"ColRow1:ColRow2"`.
*   At most `100` calls will be made to `set`, `get`, and `sum`.

There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.

Roads are represented by `connections` where `connections[i] = [a<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, b<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>]` represents a road from city `a<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` to city `b<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>`.

This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city `0`), and many people want to travel to this city.

Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city `0`. Return the **minimum** number of edges changed.

It's **guaranteed** that each city can reach city `0` after reorder.

There is an undirected weighted connected graph. You are given a positive integer `n` which denotes that the graph has `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, and an array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [u<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, v<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, weight<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>]` denotes that there is an edge between nodes `u<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` and `v<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` with weight equal to `weight<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>`.

A path from node `start` to node `end` is a sequence of nodes `[z<sub style="display: inline;">0</sub>, z<sub style="display: inline;">1</sub>,z<sub style="display: inline;">2</sub>, ..., z<sub style="display: inline;">k</sub>]` such that `z<sub style="display: inline;">0</sub> = start` and `z<sub style="display: inline;">k</sub> = end` and there is an edge between `z<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` and `z<sub style="display: inline;">i+1</sub>` where `0 <= i <= k-1`.

The distance of a path is the sum of the weights on the edges of the path. Let `distanceToLastNode(x)` denote the shortest distance of a path between node `n` and node `x`. A **restricted path** is a path that also satisfies that `distanceToLastNode(z<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>) > distanceToLastNode(z<sub style="display: inline;">i+1</sub>)` where `0 <= i <= k-1`.

Return _the number of restricted paths from node_ `1` _to node_ `n`. Since that number may be too large, return it **modulo** `10<sup>9</sup> + 7`.

### [133\. Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/), [Depth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/depth-first-search/), [Breadth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/breadth-first-search/), [Graph](https://leetcode.com/tag/graph/)


Given a reference of a node in a undirected graph.

Return a (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List <node>neighbors;
}</node>
```

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png)

```
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png)

```
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   `Node.val` is unique for each node.
*   There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
*   The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

There is an `m x n` rectangular island that borders both the **Pacific Ocean** and **Atlantic Ocean**. The **Pacific Ocean** touches the island's left and top edges, and the **Atlantic Ocean** touches the island's right and bottom edges.

The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `heights` where `heights[r][c]` represents the **height above sea level** of the cell at coordinate `(r, c)`.

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is **less than or equal to** the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

Return _a **2D list** of grid coordinates_ `result` _where_ `result[i] = [r<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, c<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>]` _denotes that rain water can flow from cell_ `(r<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, c<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>)` _to **both** the Pacific and Atlantic oceans_.

You are given `row x col` `grid` representing a map where `grid[i][j] = 1` represents land and `grid[i][j] = 0` represents water.

Grid cells are connected **horizontally/vertically** (not diagonally). The `grid` is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1\. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100\. Determine the perimeter of the island.

**Example 1:**

Input: grid = [[1,0]]
Output: 4
```

**Constraints:**

### [778\. Swim in Rising Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water/)

Difficulty: **Hard**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-search/), [Depth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/depth-first-search/), [Breadth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/breadth-first-search/), [Union Find](https://leetcode.com/tag/union-find/), [Heap (Priority Queue)](https://leetcode.com/tag/heap-priority-queue/), [Matrix](https://leetcode.com/tag/matrix/)


You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid` where each value `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at that point `(i, j)`.

The rain starts to fall. At time `t`, the depth of the water everywhere is `t`. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most `t`. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

Return _the least time until you can reach the bottom right square_ `(n - 1, n - 1)` _if you start at the top left square_ `(0, 0)`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/swim1-grid.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.
You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/swim2-grid-1.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
Output: 16
Explanation: The final route is shown.
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= n <= 50`
*   `0 <= grid[i][j] < n<sup>2</sup>`
*   Each value `grid[i][j]` is **unique**.

There is a new alien language that uses the English alphabet. However, the order among the letters is unknown to you.

You are given a list of strings `words` from the alien language's dictionary, where the strings in `words` are **sorted lexicographically** by the rules of this new language.

Return _a string of the unique letters in the new alien language sorted in **lexicographically increasing order** by the new language's rules. If there is no solution, return_ `""`_. If there are multiple solutions, return **any of them**_.

A string `s` is **lexicographically smaller** than a string `t` if at the first letter where they differ, the letter in `s` comes before the letter in `t` in the alien language. If the first `min(s.length, t.length)` letters are the same, then `s` is smaller if and only if `s.length < t.length`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["wrt","wrf","er","ett","rftt"]
Output: "wertf"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["z","x"]
Output: "zx"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["z","x","z"]
Output: ""
Explanation: The order is invalid, so return "".

#### Solution

Language: **Python**

看到给的第二个测试用例立马就明白了，就是判断这些课程能否构成有向无环图（DAG）。而任何时候判断DAG的方法要立刻想到拓扑排序。

同样是拓扑排序，但是换了个做法，使用DFS。这个方法是，我们每次找到一个新的点，判断从这个点出发是否有环。

具体做法是使用一个visited数组，当visited[i]值为0，说明还没判断这个点；当visited[i]值为1，说明当前的循环正在判断这个点；当visited[i]值为2，说明已经判断过这个点，含义是从这个点往后的所有路径都没有环，认为这个点是安全的。

那么，我们对每个点出发都做这个判断，检查这个点出发的所有路径上是否有环，如果判断过程中找到了当前的正在判断的路径，说明有环；找到了已经判断正常的点，说明往后都不可能存在环，所以认为当前的节点也是安全的。如果当前点是未知状态，那么先把当前点标记成正在访问状态，然后找后续的节点，直到找到安全的节点为止。最后如果到达了无路可走的状态，说明当前节点是安全的。

时间复杂度是O(N)，空间复杂度是O(N)。

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0\. So the correct course order is [0,1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2\. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].

## Union Find
### [721\. Accounts Merge](https://leetcode.com/problems/accounts-merge/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/), [Depth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/depth-first-search/), [Breadth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/breadth-first-search/), [Union Find](https://leetcode.com/tag/union-find/)


Given a list of `accounts` where each element `accounts[i]` is a list of strings, where the first element `accounts[i][0]` is a name, and the rest of the elements are **emails** representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails **in sorted order**. The accounts themselves can be returned in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: accounts = [["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com"],["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john00@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
Output: [["John","john00@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com","johnsmith@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
Explanation:
The first and second John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com".
The third John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.
We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'],
['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: accounts = [["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe3@m.co","Gabe1@m.co"],["Kevin","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co","Kevin0@m.co"],["Ethan","Ethan5@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan0@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo3@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo0@m.co"],["Fern","Fern5@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern0@m.co"]]
Output: [["Ethan","Ethan0@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan5@m.co"],["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe1@m.co","Gabe3@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo0@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo3@m.co"],["Kevin","Kevin0@m.co","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co"],["Fern","Fern0@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern5@m.co"]]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= accounts.length <= 1000`
*   `2 <= accounts[i].length <= 10`
*   `1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 30`

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Depth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/depth-first-search/), [Breadth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/breadth-first-search/), [Union Find](https://leetcode.com/tag/union-find/), [Matrix](https://leetcode.com/tag/matrix/)


Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 300`
*   `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/), [Union Find](https://leetcode.com/tag/union-find/)


Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`

### [305\. Number of Islands II :fire:](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands-ii/)

Difficulty: **Hard**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Union Find](https://leetcode.com/tag/union-find/)


You are given an empty 2D binary grid `grid` of size `m x n`. The grid represents a map where `0`'s represent water and `1`'s represent land. Initially, all the cells of `grid` are water cells (i.e., all the cells are `0`'s).

We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land. You are given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [r<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, c<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>]` is the position `(r<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, c<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>)` at which we should operate the `i<sup>th</sup>` operation.

Return _an array of integers_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the number of islands after turning the cell_ `(r<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, c<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>)` _into a land_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/tmp-grid.jpg)

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, positions = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,3]
Explanation:
Initially, the 2d grid is filled with water.
- Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid[0][0] into a land. We have 1 island.
- Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid[0][1] into a land. We still have 1 island.
- Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid[1][2] into a land. We have 2 islands.
- Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid[2][1] into a land. We have 3 islands.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: m = 1, n = 1, positions = [[0,0]]
Output: [1]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= m, n, positions.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `1 <= m * n <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `positions[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= r<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub> < m`
*   `0 <= c<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub> < n`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it in time complexity `O(k log(mn))`, where `k == positions.length`?


#### Solution

Language: **Python**

* Time complexity : O(m×n+L) where LL is the number of operations, m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. it takes O(m×n) to initialize UnionFind, and O(L) to process positions. Note that Union operation takes essentially constant time[1] when UnionFind is implemented with both path compression and union by rank.
* Space complexity : O(m×n) as required by UnionFind data structure.

Explanation: Change the 0 to 1 and make the island bigger, only one island with area = 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Can't change any 0 to 1, only one island with area = 4.

In this problem, a tree is an **undirected graph** that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two **different** vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array `edges` of length `n` where `edges[i] = [a<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, b<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `a<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` and `b<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` in the graph.

Return _an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of_ `n` _nodes_. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/reduntant1-1-graph.jpg)

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/reduntant1-2-graph.jpg)

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == edges.length`
*   `3 <= n <= 1000`
*   `edges[i].length == 2`
*   `1 <= a<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub> < b<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub> <= edges.length`
*   `a<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub> != b<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>`
*   There are no repeated edges.
*   The given graph is connected.

# viz
#x, y, means, new_assignments = np.array(kmeans(X, k))
#import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#plt.plot(x, y)
````

The intuition behind this approach is that spreading out the k initial cluster centers is a good thing: the first cluster center is chosen uniformly at random from the data points that are being clustered, after which each subsequent cluster center is chosen from the remaining data points with probability proportional to its squared distance from the point's closest existing cluster center.

#### Mapreduce
k-means的每一次迭代都可以分为以下3个步骤。
* 第一步：Map：对于每一个点，将其对应的最近的聚类中心
* 第二步：Combine：刚完成map的机器在本机上都分别完成同一个聚类的点的求和，减少reduce操作的通信量和计算量。
* 第三步：reduce：将同一聚类中心的中间数据再进行求和，得到新的聚类中心

算法优点：
1. 将聚类中心的信息作为全局变量，使聚类归属分配时不需要占用带宽。
2. 利用combine本地先进行同一聚类的归并，减少到reduce的传输量和计算量。
3. 算法规范，简单。

#### 英文版
* [详见](https://stanford.edu/~rezab/classes/cme323/S16/projects_reports/bodoia.pdf)
1. Choose k initial means µ1, . . . , µk uniformly at random from the set X.
2. Apply the MapReduce given by k-meansMap and k-meansReduce to X.
3. Compute the new means µ1, . . . , µk from the results of the MapReduce.
4. Broadcast the new means to each machine on the cluster.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 until the means have converged.

#### Stopping Condition for K-Means clustering:
1. Centroids of the newly formed cluster remains the same as in the previous step.
2. Data points in the cluster does not change.
3. The maximum number of iterations is reached.

#### Assumption of Kmeans
* k-means assume the variance of the distribution of each attribute (variable) is spherical;
* all variables have the same variance;
* the prior probability for all k clusters are the same, i.e. each cluster has roughly equal number of observations;

If any one of these 3 assumptions is violated, then k-means will fail.

#### The optimal number of clusters can be defined as follow:
* Compute clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means clustering) for different values of k. For instance, by varying k from 1 to 10 clusters.
* For each k, calculate the total within-cluster sum of square (wss).
* Plot the curve of wss according to the number of clusters k.
* The location of a bend (knee) in the plot is generally considered as an indicator of the appropriate number of clusters.

###  Rejection Sampling
```python
from random import randint

def rand7():
    return randint(1, 7)

def rand10():
    c = (rand7() - 1)*7 + rand7() - 1
    return rand10() if c >= 40 else (c % 10) + 1    
```

###  Weighted Sampling
```python
from __future__ import division
from random import uniform

def weight_sampling(nums):
    total = sum(nums)
    nums = [num / total for num in nums]
    weights = []
    cum_sum = 0
    for num in nums:
        cum_sum += num
        weights.append(cum_sum)     
    return sum([uniform(0, 1) > weight for weight in weights])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    nums = [1, 3]
    weight_sampling(nums)
    trials = [weight_sampling(nums) for _ in range(1000)]
```

###  Reservoir sampling
```python
from random import randint

def reservoir_sampling(nums, k):
    result = []
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if i < k:
            result.append(num)
        else:
            j = randint(0, i)
            if j < k:
                result[j] = num
    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    nums = [1, 2, 3]
    k = 2
    reservoir_sampling(nums, k)
```
Proof:
* For `k+i`, the probability that it is selected and will replace a number in the reservoir is `k/(k+i)`
* For a number in the reservoir before (let's say `X`), the probability that it keeps staying in the reservoir is
    * `P(X was in the reservoir last time)` × `P(X is not replaced by k+i)`
    * = `P(X was in the reservoir last time)` × (`1` - `P(k+i is selected and replaces X)`)
    * = `k/(k+i-1)` × `（1 - k/(k+i) × 1/k）`
    * = `k/(k+i)`
* When `k+i` reaches n, the probability of each number staying in the reservoir is `k/n`

Example
* Choose `3` numbers from `[111, 222, 333, 444]`. Make sure each number is selected with a probability of `3/4`
* First, choose `[111, 222, 333]` as the initial reservior
* Then choose `444` with a probability of `3/4`
* For `111`, it stays with a probability of
    * P(`444` is not selected) + P(`444` is selected but it replaces `222` or `333`)
    * = `1/4` + `3/4`*`2/3`
    * = `3/4`
* The same case with `222` and `333`
* Now all the numbers have the probability of `3/4` to be picked

### AUC
```python
# ml
## 第二轮店面,手写precision, recall, 和三个ml问题:
```python
from __future__ import division
import random
n = 1000
ys = [random.randint(0, 1) for _ in range(n)]
y_preds = [random.random() for _ in range(n)]

def pr(ys, y_preds, threshold):
    y_hats = [1 if y_pred > threshold else 0 for y_pred in y_preds]
    tp, fp, tn, fn = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for y_hat, y in zip(y_hats, ys):
        if y_hat == 1 and y == 1:
            tp += 1
        elif y_hat == 1 and y == 0:
            fp += 1
        elif y_hat == 0 and y == 0:
            tn += 1
        elif y_hat == 0 and y == 1:
            fn += 1
    #print tp, fp, tn, fn
    precision = 0 if tp + fp == 0 else tp / (tp + fp)
    recall = 0 if fp + tn == 0 else tp / (tp + fn)
    return precision, recall

xaxis, yaxis = [], []

for y_pred in y_preds:
    precision, recall  = pr(ys, y_preds, y_pred)
    xaxis.append(recall)
    yaxis.append(precision)

pr_curve = [(x, y) for x, y in zip(xaxis, yaxis)]
pr_curve.sort()
pr_curve[0] = (0,1)
pr_curve.append((1, 0))
auc = 0
for i in range(1, len(pr_curve)):
    point_a = pr_curve[i - 1]
    point_b = pr_curve[i]
    auc += (point_a[1] + point_b[1]) * abs(point_a[0] - point_b[0]) * 0.5
auc
```
